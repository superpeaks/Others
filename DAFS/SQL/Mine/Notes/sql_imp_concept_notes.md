## 🔐 Practical Keys in MySQL

### 1. **Primary Key**
- **Purpose**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Rules**:
  - Must be **unique**.
  - Cannot contain **NULL** values.
  - A table can have **only one** primary key.
- **Common Usage**: Often assigned to an `id` column using `AUTO_INCREMENT`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### 2. **Unique Key**
- **Purpose**: Ensures that all values in a column (or combination of columns) are distinct.
- **Difference from Primary Key**:
  - Can contain **NULL** (depends on storage engine).
  - Can have **multiple unique keys** per table.
- **Usage**: Email, username fields.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);
```

---

### 3. **Foreign Key**
- **Purpose**: Establishes a link between two tables.
- **Enforces**: Referential integrity (ensures the foreign value exists in the parent table).
- **Can use**: `ON DELETE`, `ON UPDATE` actions like `CASCADE` or `SET NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

---

### 4. **Index Key**
- **Purpose**: Speeds up SELECT queries by indexing columns.
- **No constraint enforcement**.
- Can be applied to any column (including non-unique).

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Users(name);
```

---

### 5. **Composite Key**
- **Definition**: A key composed of multiple columns.
- Can be used as a **Primary**, **Unique**, or **Foreign key**.
- Ensures uniqueness based on the combined values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

---

### 6. **Full-text Key**
- **Purpose**: Enables complex search functions on textual columns.
- **Used With**: `MATCH()` and `AGAINST()` queries.
- Only available with **InnoDB** and **MyISAM** engines.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Articles (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT,
  FULLTEXT(content)
);
```

---

## 🧠 Relational Theory Keys

### 7. **Candidate Key**
- Any column or combo of columns that **can uniquely identify** each record.
- One is chosen as the **Primary Key**, others become **Alternate Keys**.
- Must be **unique** and **not null**.

---

### 8. **Alternate Key**
- Candidate keys that were *not* chosen as the primary key.
- May be used as **unique constraints** to ensure data integrity.

---

### 9. **Super Key**
- Any set of columns that **can uniquely identify** rows.
- May contain *extra columns* that aren’t necessary for uniqueness.

> Example: If `user_id` is enough to uniquely identify a user, then `user_id + email` is still a super key—but not minimal.

---

### 10. **Surrogate Key**
- Artificial key, not derived from data.
- Often implemented using an auto-incremented field.
- Used when there’s no suitable natural key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  ssn VARCHAR(12),
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### 11. **Natural Key**
- Real-world attribute used as a key.
- Example: using `email` or `SSN` as a unique identifier.
- Can become primary or candidate keys but may complicate schema if values change.

---

## ⚙️ Supporting Key Concepts

### ➤ Auto-Increment Keys
- Automatically assign sequential values to primary keys.
- Easy way to implement surrogate keys.

### ➤ Foreign Key Constraints
- Define rules for maintaining relationships between tables.
- Prevent orphan records or allow cascading effects.

### ➤ Partial Keys
- Part of a **composite key**.
- Alone, it can't ensure uniqueness—works only in combination.

### ➤ Covering Keys
- Indexes that cover all columns used in a query.
- Helps avoid reading from the full table—boosts performance.

MySQL supports a variety of operators for performing operations in queries. Here's a comprehensive list of MySQL operators:

### **1. Arithmetic Operators**
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulo)

### **2. Comparison Operators**
- `=` (Equal)
- `!=` or `<>` (Not Equal)
- `>` (Greater Than)
- `<` (Less Than)
- `>=` (Greater Than or Equal To)
- `<=` (Less Than or Equal To)
- `<=>` (NULL-safe Equal To)

### **3. Logical Operators**
- `AND` (Logical AND)
- `OR` (Logical OR)
- `XOR` (Logical XOR)
- `NOT` (Logical NOT)

### **4. Bitwise Operators**
- `&` (Bitwise AND)
- `|` (Bitwise OR)

- `IS NOT NULL` (Checks for non-NULL values)
- `COALESCE()` (Returns first non-NULL value)

Let me know if you need explanations for any of these. Do you have a specific query where you'd like to use operators?
Conditional statements in MySQL allow you to make decisions and execute specific code based on certain conditions. Here are the main conditional statements used in MySQL:

### **1. `IF()` Function**
The `IF()` function evaluates a condition and returns different values based on whether the condition is true or false.

```sql
SELECT IF(10 > 5, 'True', 'False');
```
_Output: `True`_

### **2. `IF...ELSEIF...ELSE` Statement**
Used in stored procedures or triggers to handle multiple conditions.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE CheckNumber(IN num INT)
BEGIN
    IF num > 0 THEN
        SELECT 'Positive';
    ELSEIF num < 0 THEN
        SELECT 'Negative';
    ELSE
        SELECT 'Zero';
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### **3. `CASE` Statement**
Used for handling multiple conditions in a structured way.

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN 10 > 5 THEN 'Greater'
        WHEN 10 = 5 THEN 'Equal'
        ELSE 'Smaller'
    END AS Result;
```

### **4. `IF EXISTS` & `IF NOT EXISTS`**
Used to check the existence of records before executing a statement.

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1) 
    THEN UPDATE users SET name = 'John' WHERE id = 1;
```

### **5. `WHERE` Clause with Conditional Operators**
Used in queries to filter results based on conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

Conditional statements are crucial for making dynamic queries and logic-driven decisions within MySQL. Would you like an example based on a specific use case?























In MySQL, looping statements are primarily used in stored procedures to execute repetitive tasks. Here are the main looping constructs in MySQL:

### **1. `WHILE` Loop**
Executes a block of statements repeatedly while a condition remains true.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE WhileLoopExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1;
    
    WHILE counter <= 5 DO
        SELECT CONCAT('Iteration: ', counter);
        SET counter = counter + 1;
    END WHILE;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### **2. `REPEAT` Loop**
Executes a block of statements at least once and then repeats while a condition remains true.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE RepeatLoopExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1;
    
    REPEAT
        SELECT CONCAT('Iteration: ', counter);
        SET counter = counter + 1;
    UNTIL counter > 5 END REPEAT;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### **3. `LOOP` Statement**
Provides flexibility and requires an explicit `LEAVE` statement to exit the loop.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE LoopExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1;
    
    loop_label: LOOP
        SELECT CONCAT('Iteration: ', counter);
        SET counter = counter + 1;
        
        IF counter > 5 THEN
            LEAVE loop_label;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### **4. `CURSOR` with Loops**
Used to iterate over query results row by row.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE CursorLoopExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE emp_name VARCHAR(100);
    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT name FROM employees;
    
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;
    
    OPEN cur;
    
    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH cur INTO emp_name;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;
        SELECT emp_name;
    END LOOP;
    
    CLOSE cur;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

Loops are particularly useful for automation and batch processing in MySQL. Do you have a specific scenario where you’d like to use looping? I’d be happy to help refine the logic.
 
Handling `NULL` values in MySQL is essential to ensure data integrity and prevent errors. Here are some common techniques for managing `NULL` values:

### **1. Using `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`**
Check for `NULL` values explicitly in queries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;
```

### **2. Using `COALESCE()`**
Returns the first non-NULL value from a list.

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, 'Default Value', 'Another Value');
```
_Output: `'Default Value'`_

### **3. Using `IFNULL()`**
Replaces `NULL` with a specified value.

```sql
SELECT IFNULL(NULL, 'Fallback');
```
_Output: `'Fallback'`_

### **4. Handling `NULL` in Aggregate Functions**
MySQL aggregates ignore `NULL` values.

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;
```

### **5. Using Default Values in Table Definitions**
Prevent `NULL` values by setting default values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT DEFAULT 25
);
```

### **6. Handling `NULL` in String Operations**
Concatenating `NULL` with strings results in `NULL`. Use `COALESCE()` to avoid issues.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT('Hello ', COALESCE(NULL, 'World'));
```
_Output: `'Hello World'`_

### **7. Using `CASE` for Conditional Handling**
Replace `NULL` with alternative values dynamically.

```sql
SELECT name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN age IS NULL THEN 'Unknown' 
        ELSE age 
    END AS age_status
FROM users;
```

These techniques help in managing `NULL` values efficiently. Do you have a specific scenario where you need help handling `NULL` values? 🚀
 
MySQL provides a variety of **string functions** for manipulating and processing text data. Here’s a comprehensive list:

### **1. String Case Functions**
- `UPPER(str) / UCASE(str)` → Converts string to uppercase.
- `LOWER(str) / LCASE(str)` → Converts string to lowercase.
- `INITCAP(str)` → Capitalizes first letter of each word (available in some MySQL versions).

### **2. String Concatenation**
- `CONCAT(str1, str2, ...)` → Joins multiple strings.
- `CONCAT_WS(separator, str1, str2, ...)` → Concatenates strings with a separator.

### **3. Substring Functions**
- `SUBSTRING(str, start, length)` → Extracts part of a string.
- `SUBSTRING_INDEX(str, delimiter, count)` → Extracts substring based on delimiter.
- `LEFT(str, length)` → Extracts the leftmost characters.
- `RIGHT(str, length)` → Extracts the rightmost characters.

### **4. String Length Functions**
- `LENGTH(str)` → Returns byte length of a string.
- `CHAR_LENGTH(str) / CHARACTER_LENGTH(str)` → Returns number of characters in a string.

### **5. Trimming & Padding Functions**
- `LTRIM(str)` → Removes leading spaces.
- `RTRIM(str)` → Removes trailing spaces.
- `TRIM([BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] trim_str FROM str)` → Removes specified characters from string.
- `LPAD(str, length, pad_str)` → Pads on the left.
- `RPAD(str, length, pad_str)` → Pads on the right.

### **6. String Replacement & Modification**
- `REPLACE(str, from_str, to_str)` → Replaces occurrences of a substring.
- `INSERT(str, start, length, new_str)` → Inserts new string at specified position.

### **7. Searching & Matching**
- `LOCATE(substr, str, start_position)` → Returns position of substring.
- `POSITION(substr IN str)` → Finds position of substring.
- `INSTR(str, substr)` → Returns position of substring.
- `LIKE` → Pattern matching using `%` and `_`.
- `REGEXP` / `RLIKE` → Regular expression matching.

- `SHA1(str)` → Generates SHA-1 hash.
- `SHA2(str, bit_length)` → Generates SHA-2 hash.

### **10. Special Formatting**
- `FORMAT(number, decimal_places)` → Formats number with commas.
- `QUOTE(str)` → Adds single quotes around a string.

These functions help in efficient text manipulation within MySQL. Need help with a specific one? 🚀

 
In MySQL, regular expressions (regex) are used to perform complex pattern matching in queries. The main function for regex operations is **REGEXP** (or **RLIKE**, which is synonymous).

### **How REGEXP works in MySQL:**
- It matches a string against a regex pattern.
- Returns `1` (true) if there is a match, otherwise `0` (false).

### **Basic Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name REGEXP 'pattern';
```

### **Examples:**
1. **Finding names that start with "J"**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE name REGEXP '^J';
   ```
   - `^J` ensures names start with 'J'.

2. **Finding email addresses that end with ".com"**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email REGEXP '.com$';
   ```
   - `$` matches at the end.

3. **Finding phone numbers containing "123"**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE phone REGEXP '123';
   ```
   - Finds "123" anywhere in the phone number.

### **Common Regex Patterns in MySQL:**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|--------|
| `^abc`  | Starts with "abc" |
| `abc$`  | Ends with "abc" |
| `.`     | Matches any character |
| `[0-9]` | Matches any digit |
| `[a-z]` | Matches any lowercase letter |
| `[A-Z]` | Matches any uppercase letter |
| `a|b`   | Matches "a" or "b" |
| `*`     | Matches 0 or more of the preceding character |
| `+`     | Matches 1 or more of the preceding character |

Would you like a practical example or a more advanced use case?
 
Sure! MySQL supports a subset of **regular expressions** (regex) using **REGEXP** or **RLIKE**. Here's a list of common regex patterns you can use in MySQL:

### **Basic Patterns**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `^abc`  | Matches strings starting with "abc" |
| `abc$`  | Matches strings ending with "abc" |
| `.`     | Matches any single character |
| `[...]` | Matches any character inside the brackets, e.g., `[a-z]` matches lowercase letters |
| `[^...]` | Matches any character **not** inside the brackets |
| `a|b`   | Matches "a" or "b" |

### **Quantifiers**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `*`     | Matches 0 or more occurrences of the previous character |
| `+`     | Matches 1 or more occurrences of the previous character |
| `?`     | Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the previous character |
| `{n}`   | Matches **exactly** n occurrences |
| `{n,}`  | Matches **at least** n occurrences |
| `{n,m}` | Matches between n and m occurrences |

### **Character Classes**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `[0-9]` | Matches any digit |
| `[a-z]` | Matches any lowercase letter |
| `[A-Z]` | Matches any uppercase letter |
| `[[:digit:]]` | Matches any digit (`[0-9]`) |
| `[[:alpha:]]` | Matches any letter (`[A-Za-z]`) |
| `[[:alnum:]]` | Matches any alphanumeric character (`[A-Za-z0-9]`) |
| `[[:space:]]` | Matches any whitespace character |
| `[[:punct:]]` | Matches any punctuation character |

### **Anchors**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `^`     | Matches the start of a string |
| `$`     | Matches the end of a string |

### **Escape Characters**
Use `\\` to escape special characters when needed. For example, `.` matches any character, but `\\.` matches a literal dot (`.`).

Would you like an example query to see how these work in MySQL?
 
In MySQL, **joins** are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins, each serving a different purpose.

### **Types of Joins in MySQL:**

#### **1. INNER JOIN (Default JOIN)**
- Retrieves matching records from both tables.
- Excludes rows where there’s no match in either table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### **2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
- Returns all records from the **left** table and matching records from the right table.
- If no match is found, `NULL` values are returned from the right table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### **3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
- Returns all records from the **right** table and matching records from the left table.
- If no match is found, `NULL` values are returned from the left table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### **4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**
- Returns all records from both tables.
- If there is no match, `NULL` values are filled where applicable.
- **Note**: MySQL does not directly support FULL OUTER JOIN, but you can mimic it using **UNION**:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id

UNION

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### **5. CROSS JOIN**
- Produces a Cartesian product—combining every row of the first table with every row of the second table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

#### **6. SELF JOIN**
- Joins a table with itself to compare data within the same table.

```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee1, e2.name AS Employee2
FROM employees e1
INNER JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

### **Visual Representation of Joins**
Each join has different applications based on the data you need to fetch. Would you like a diagram or an example dataset to help visualize this better?


In MySQL, **`UNION`** and **`UNION ALL`** are used to combine the results of multiple **SELECT** queries into a single result set.

### **Difference Between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`**
| Clause | Behavior |
|--------|---------|
| **`UNION`** | Removes duplicates, returning only distinct rows. |
| **`UNION ALL`** | Returns all rows, including duplicates. |

---

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name FROM table2;
```

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name FROM table2;
```

---

### **Examples**
#### ✅ **Example of `UNION` (Removing Duplicates)**
```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```
✅ If both tables have the city **"Mumbai"**, it appears only **once** in the result.

---

#### ✅ **Example of `UNION ALL` (Keeping Duplicates)**
```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```
✅ If both tables have **"Mumbai"**, it appears **twice** in the result.

---

### **Key Rules**
1. **Same Number of Columns**: Both SELECT statements must have the same number of columns.
2. **Same Data Types**: The columns must have compatible data types.

Would you like a more complex use case, such as combining different datasets? 🚀



### **Usage of `UNION` and `UNION ALL` in MySQL**
Both `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are commonly used to:
1. **Combine multiple result sets** from different tables or queries.
2. **Retrieve distinct records** (`UNION`) or preserve duplicates (`UNION ALL`).
3. **Aggregate data from similar tables** that have identical column structures.
4. **Merge query results without needing a join** when tables don't share common keys.

---

### **Real-World Use Cases**
#### ✅ **1. Combining Customer and Supplier Data**
```sql
SELECT name, city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name, city FROM suppliers;
```
✔ Retrieves **unique** names and cities from both tables.

#### ✅ **2. Viewing All Transactions Without Duplicates**
```sql
SELECT order_id, amount FROM online_orders
UNION
SELECT order_id, amount FROM in_store_orders;
```
✔ Shows **distinct** orders across different platforms.

#### ✅ **3. Keeping All Records Including Duplicates**
```sql
SELECT product_name FROM store_A
UNION ALL
SELECT product_name FROM store_B;
```
✔ Displays **all products**, even if sold in both stores.

#### ✅ **4. Merging Results Without Complex Joins**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, department FROM old_employees
UNION ALL
SELECT employee_name, department FROM new_employees;
```
✔ Combines **all employee records**, even if duplicated.

In MySQL, **window functions** allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing them into a single result, like aggregate functions. They are useful for ranking, running totals, moving averages, and more.

### **Types of Window Functions in MySQL**

#### **1. Aggregate Window Functions**
These are similar to regular aggregate functions but operate over a window of rows.
- `SUM()` – Computes the sum over a partition.
- `AVG()` – Finds the average value over a partition.
- `MIN()` – Gets the minimum value over a partition.
- `MAX()` – Gets the maximum value over a partition.
- `COUNT()` – Counts the number of rows in a partition.

```sql
SELECT department, employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS total_department_salary
FROM employees;
```
*Calculates the total salary per department.*

---

#### **2. Ranking and Ordering Functions**
Used for ranking rows based on order.

- `ROW_NUMBER()` – Assigns a unique rank to each row within the partition.
- `RANK()` – Assigns a rank with gaps if there are duplicate values.
- `DENSE_RANK()` – Similar to `RANK()` but without gaps in numbering.
- `NTILE(n)` – Splits rows into `n` equal groups.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```
*Ranks employees based on salary.*

---

#### **3. Value-Based Window Functions**
Used to access specific rows within the partition.

- `LEAD(column, offset, default)` – Retrieves the value from the next row.
- `LAG(column, offset, default)` – Retrieves the value from the previous row.
- `FIRST_VALUE(column)` – Returns the first value in the partition.
- `LAST_VALUE(column)` – Returns the last value in the partition.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       LAG(salary, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS previous_salary
FROM employees;
```
*Shows the previous salary for each employee.*

---

#### **4. Moving Window Functions**
Used for calculations over a specified range.

- `CUME_DIST()` – Calculates the cumulative distribution.
- `PERCENT_RANK()` – Shows percentile rank of each row.
- `RANK()` – Assigns rank based on ordering.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS percentile_salary
FROM employees;
```
*Gets the percentile rank for each employee based on salary.*

---

### **Defining a Window Clause**
The **`OVER()`** clause defines the window for the function.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_salary
FROM employees;
```
*Calculates a running total for the last two salaries.*

Would you like a real-world example or dataset to see this in action?
The **`OVER()`** clause in MySQL is essential for window functions, defining how rows are grouped and ordered for calculations. Here are all the syntax variations:

---

### **1. Basic Syntax**
```sql
window_function() OVER ()
```
Used without partitioning or ordering.

---

### **2. Partitioning**
```sql
window_function() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name)
```
Divides the result set into groups. Example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, department, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS department_salary
FROM employees;
```

---

### **3. Ordering**
```sql
window_function() OVER (ORDER BY column_name)
```
Orders rows within the window. Example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

---

### **4. Partition + Ordering**
```sql
window_function() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name)
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, department, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS running_total
FROM employees;
```

---

### **5. Frame Specifications**
#### **Rows-Based**
```sql
window_function() OVER (ORDER BY column_name ROWS BETWEEN start AND end)
```
Example:
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_total
FROM employees;
```

#### **Range-Based**
```sql
window_function() OVER (ORDER BY column_name RANGE BETWEEN start AND end)
```
Example:
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       AVG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_avg
FROM employees;
```

---

### **6. First/Last Row in Partition**
```sql
FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name)
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name)
```
Example:
```sql
SELECT employee_name, department, salary,
       FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees;

In MySQL, **`ROWS BETWEEN`** and **`RANGE BETWEEN`** are used in the **window functions** to define a subset of rows within a window. They control which rows are considered when performing calculations.

### **Difference Between `ROWS BETWEEN` and `RANGE BETWEEN`**
| Clause | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **ROWS BETWEEN** | Works with **physical** row positions, considering a fixed number of rows before or after the current row. |
| **RANGE BETWEEN** | Works with **value-based** ranges, considering rows **with the same ordering value** rather than row position. |

### **Common Syntax**
```sql
window_function() OVER (
    ORDER BY column_name
    ROWS BETWEEN start AND end
)
```
```sql
window_function() OVER (
    ORDER BY column_name
    RANGE BETWEEN start AND end
)
```

### **Examples**
#### **1. Using `ROWS BETWEEN` (Physical Row-Based Calculation)**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_total
FROM employees;
```
✅ Includes the current row and the 2 preceding rows in the sum calculation.

---

#### **2. Using `RANGE BETWEEN` (Value-Based Calculation)**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_total
FROM employees;
```
✅ Includes all rows with **equal salary values** or those before the current row in the sum.

---

### **Types of Window Frames**
| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` | Includes all rows from the beginning up to the current row |
| `BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` | Includes the current row and all rows after it |
| `BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` | Includes the previous N rows plus the current row |
| `BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND N FOLLOWING` | Includes the current row and the next N rows |

Great question! In MySQL's **window functions**, the **`ROWS BETWEEN`** and **`RANGE BETWEEN`** clauses help define a subset of rows for calculations. Below are all the **keywords** you can use within these clauses:

### **Common Keywords Used in `ROWS BETWEEN` and `RANGE BETWEEN`**
| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `ROWS` | Defines a row-based frame (physical row positions). |
| `RANGE` | Defines a range-based frame (value-based comparison). |
| `BETWEEN` | Specifies the range of rows within the frame. |
| `PRECEDING` | Includes rows before the current row. |
| `FOLLOWING` | Includes rows after the current row. |
| `CURRENT ROW` | Includes only the current row. |
| `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` | Includes all rows before the current row. |
| `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` | Includes all rows after the current row. |

### **Examples**
#### **1. Using `ROWS BETWEEN` for a Rolling Sum**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_sum
FROM employees;
```
✅ Includes the current row and the **2 preceding rows**.

#### **2. Using `RANGE BETWEEN` for Cumulative Sum**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_sum
FROM employees;
```
✅ Includes **all rows** before the current row based on salary **value**.

### **Types of Partitioning in MySQL**
Partitioning in MySQL helps divide large tables into smaller, more manageable parts for improved performance and efficiency. Here are the main types of partitioning, along with syntax, usage, and rules.

---

### **1. RANGE Partitioning**
Divides data into partitions based on a range of values in a column.

#### ✅ **Usage**
Ideal for tables with date or numerical values that can be segmented logically.

#### 🖋 **Syntax**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, sale_date)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2023),
    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```
✅ **Rules**
- The partition key **must** be part of the **PRIMARY KEY**.
- Values **must** be **increasing**, with **MAXVALUE** handling anything beyond the last partition.

---

### **2. LIST Partitioning**
Similar to RANGE, but divides data based on a **list of specific values**.

#### ✅ **Usage**
Useful when categorizing data based on predefined groups (e.g., departments, regions).

#### 🖋 **Syntax**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, department)
)
PARTITION BY LIST (department) (
    PARTITION p1 VALUES IN ('HR', 'Finance'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES IN ('IT', 'Engineering'),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES IN ('Marketing', 'Sales')
);
```
✅ **Rules**
- Each partition must **explicitly define its values**.
- The column used for partitioning **must** be part of the **PRIMARY KEY**.

---

### **3. HASH Partitioning**
Distributes rows **evenly** across a predefined number of partitions using a hash function.

#### ✅ **Usage**
Useful when you don’t have a natural range but want automatic distribution.

#### 🖋 **Syntax**
```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    log_date DATE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, log_date)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(YEAR(log_date)) PARTITIONS 4;
```
✅ **Rules**
- The number of partitions must be **specified explicitly**.
- Partition allocation is **automatic**, based on the **HASH function**.

---

### **4. KEY Partitioning**
Similar to HASH, but uses MySQL’s **internal hashing mechanism**.

#### ✅ **Usage**
Best for large datasets where uniform distribution across partitions is required.

#### 🖋 **Syntax**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
PARTITION BY KEY(id) PARTITIONS 3;
```
✅ **Rules**
- The partitioning column must be **part of the PRIMARY KEY**.
- MySQL's internal function determines partition allocation.

---

### **Querying Partitioned Tables**
To retrieve data from a **specific partition**, use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales PARTITION (p1) WHERE amount > 100;
```

Partitioning **boosts performance** but has some limitations:
❌ You **cannot** have foreign keys across partitions.  
❌ You **cannot** update the partition key.  

Would you like help choosing a partitioning strategy for your dataset? 🚀


Partition pruning in MySQL helps optimize queries by scanning **only relevant partitions** instead of the entire table, improving performance. You can analyze partition pruning using **EXPLAIN** and other techniques.

### **🔍 How to Analyze Partition Pruning**
#### **1. Use `EXPLAIN` to Check Partition Usage**
You can use the `EXPLAIN` statement to see which partitions MySQL is scanning.
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= '2022-01-01';
```
✅ **Check the output:** If partition pruning is working, MySQL will mention the specific partitions used.

---

#### **2. Enable `OPTIMIZER_TRACE`**
This helps track how MySQL optimizes queries, including partition pruning.
```sql
SET optimizer_trace="enabled=on";
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= '2022-01-01';
SELECT * FROM information_schema.optimizer_trace;
```
✅ **Check results** in `optimizer_trace` to verify pruning efficiency.

---

#### **3. Use `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to Validate Partition Setup**
Ensure partitioning is properly defined.
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE sales;
```
✅ If partition rules are incorrect, pruning **won’t work** properly.

---

#### **4. Avoid Functions on Partition Columns**
**🚨 Partition pruning fails when using functions like `YEAR()` or `DATE()` in WHERE clauses!**
❌ **Bad Query (No Pruning)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2022;
```
✔ **Good Query (Pruning Works)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= '2022-01-01' AND sale_date < '2023-01-01';
```

---

#### **5. Use `EXPLAIN PARTITIONS` to Confirm Partition Usage**
```sql
EXPLAIN PARTITIONS SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= '2022-01-01';
```
✅ Shows which partitions MySQL **will scan**.

Would you like help optimizing a specific query for better partition pruning? 🚀



In MySQL, you can modify (`ALTER`) or remove (`DROP`) partitions in a partitioned table to manage data efficiently.

---

### **🔹 ALTER PARTITION in MySQL**
Used to **modify** partition properties.

#### ✅ **Examples**
1️⃣ **Adding a New Partition (RANGE Partitioning)**
```sql
ALTER TABLE sales ADD PARTITION (
    PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN (2025)
);
```
✔ Adds a new partition for sales before **2025**.

2️⃣ **Reorganizing Partitions (Merging Two Partitions)**
```sql
ALTER TABLE sales REORGANIZE PARTITION p1, p2 INTO (
    PARTITION p_new VALUES LESS THAN (2022)
);
```
✔ Merges **p1 & p2** into **p_new**.

---

### **🔹 DROP PARTITION in MySQL**
Used to **remove** partitions along with their data.

#### ✅ **Examples**
1️⃣ **Dropping a Single Partition**
```sql
ALTER TABLE sales DROP PARTITION p1;
```
✔ Deletes all data in partition **p1**.

2️⃣ **Dropping Multiple Partitions**
```sql
ALTER TABLE sales DROP PARTITION p1, p2;
```
✔ Deletes **p1 & p2**, freeing space.

---

### **🚨 Important Rules**
✔ **You cannot drop the last partition** from a table.  
✔ **Dropping partitions permanently deletes data** inside them.  
✔ **Ensure partition pruning is optimized** before altering partitions.

Transaction Control Language (TCL) in MySQL is used to manage transactions and ensure data integrity in relational databases. It includes commands that allow users to commit, rollback, and set savepoints within transactions.

### **TCL Commands in MySQL**
1. **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the current transaction permanently.
   - **Syntax**: `COMMIT;`
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     UPDATE Customers SET age = 32 WHERE customer_id = 1;
     COMMIT;
     ```
   - Once committed, changes cannot be undone.

2. **ROLLBACK**: Reverts all changes made during the current transaction that have not been committed.
   - **Syntax**: `ROLLBACK;`
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     DELETE FROM Orders WHERE order_id = 5;
     ROLLBACK;
     ```
   - This restores the database to its previous state before the transaction.

3. **SAVEPOINT**: Creates a checkpoint within a transaction to which you can roll back.
   - **Syntax**: `SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;`
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     UPDATE Customers SET country = 'Canada' WHERE customer_id = 2;
     SAVEPOINT SP1;
     UPDATE Customers SET age = 30 WHERE customer_id = 3;
     SAVEPOINT SP2;
     ROLLBACK TO SP1;
     ```
   - This allows rolling back only part of the transaction.

4. **SET TRANSACTION**: Configures transaction behavior, ensuring proper isolation and consistency.
   - **Syntax**: `SET TRANSACTION [READ WRITE | READ ONLY];`

### **Advantages of TCL**
- **Ensures Data Integrity**: Transactions either complete fully or not at all.
- **Error Recovery**: Allows rolling back incomplete transactions.
- **Savepoints**: Provide intermediate checkpoints for finer control.

### **Disadvantages of TCL**
- **Performance Overhead**: Frequent commits and rollbacks can slow down operations.
- **Complexity**: Managing transactions in large systems can be challenging.
- **Resource Locking**: Long transactions may hold locks, reducing concurrency.

Normalization in MySQL is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships among them. 

### **Types of Normalization:**
Normalization is done in multiple stages, known as normal forms (NF). Here are the most common ones:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**  
   - Ensures each column contains atomic values (no multiple values in a single field).  
   - Eliminates duplicate columns from the same table.

2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**  
   - Meets the criteria for 1NF and eliminates partial dependencies (where a non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key).

3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**  
   - Meets the criteria for 2NF and removes transitive dependencies (where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute).

4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**  
   - A stricter version of 3NF that ensures there are no functional dependencies except for a candidate key.

5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**  
   - Removes multi-valued dependencies.

6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**  
   - Eliminates join dependencies ensuring no redundancy exists.

### **Usage Rules & Best Practices:**
- Always ensure 1NF before moving to higher levels.
- Choose 3NF or BCNF for most applications as they strike a balance between normalization and performance.
- Avoid excessive normalization, which may lead to complex queries and slow performance.
- Index primary keys and frequently queried columns for efficiency.

### **Example of Normalization:**
#### **Unnormalized Table (Before 1NF)**
| StudentID | StudentName | Subjects |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1         | Alice      | Math, English |
| 2         | Bob        | Science, Math |
| 3         | Charlie    | History, English |

#### **Normalized Table (After 1NF)**
| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|------------|
| 1         | Alice      |
| 2         | Bob        |
| 3         | Charlie    |

| StudentID | Subject  |
|-----------|---------|
| 1         | Math    |
| 1         | English |
| 2         | Science |
| 2         | Math    |
| 3         | History |
| 3         | English |

Here, we split subjects into a separate table to achieve atomic values in each field.

Would you like an example for a higher level of normalization like 3NF? 😊


Sure! Here’s an example demonstrating how a table transforms through six types of normalization in MySQL:

### **Scenario:**  
Consider a student database where we initially store data without normalization.

---

### **Unnormalized Form (UNF) – No Normalization:**  
| StudentID | Name  | Course         | Instructor  | InstructorContact |
|-----------|------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1         | Alice | Math, Physics | John, Mary | 12345, 67890      |
| 2         | Bob   | Math, Chemistry | John, Steve | 12345, 54321    |

**Issues:**  
- Multiple values in a single field (Course, Instructor, InstructorContact).
- Redundant data for instructor information.

---

### **1st Normal Form (1NF) – Atomic Values:**  
| StudentID | Name  | Course   | Instructor | InstructorContact |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| 1         | Alice | Math    | John       | 12345             |
| 1         | Alice | Physics | Mary       | 67890             |
| 2         | Bob   | Math    | John       | 12345             |
| 2         | Bob   | Chemistry | Steve    | 54321             |

**Fix:**  
- Each field contains atomic values, eliminating multiple values per field.

---

### **2nd Normal Form (2NF) – Remove Partial Dependencies:**  
Split into separate tables:

**Students Table:**  
| StudentID | Name  |
|-----------|------|
| 1         | Alice |
| 2         | Bob   |

**Courses Table:**  
| CourseID | Course   |
|----------|---------|
| C1       | Math    |
| C2       | Physics |
| C3       | Chemistry |

**Student-Course Mapping Table:**  
| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|---------|
| 1         | C1      |
| 1         | C2      |
| 2         | C1      |
| 2         | C3      |

**Instructor Table:**  
| InstructorID | Instructor | Contact |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| I1          | John      | 12345  |
| I2          | Mary      | 67890  |
| I3          | Steve     | 54321  |

**Fix:**  
- Eliminates partial dependencies (Course dependent on StudentID).

---

### **3rd Normal Form (3NF) – Remove Transitive Dependencies:**  
Break down relationships further.

**Course-Instructor Mapping:**  
| CourseID | InstructorID |
|----------|-------------|
| C1       | I1          |
| C2       | I2          |
| C3       | I3          |

**Fix:**  
- Instructor contact is now separate, avoiding transitive dependency.

---

### **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) – Handle Functional Dependencies:**  
If a course is taught by multiple instructors, normalization ensures no redundancy.

**Course-Instructor Table Updated:**  
| CourseID | InstructorID |
|----------|-------------|
| C1       | I1          |
| C1       | I3          |
| C2       | I2          |
| C3       | I3          |

**Fix:**  
- Handles cases where a non-key attribute determines another non-key attribute.

---

### **4th Normal Form (4NF) – Handle Multi-Valued Dependencies:**  
If instructors are linked to multiple subjects independently, create separate mappings:

**Instructor-Subjects Table:**  
| InstructorID | Subject   |
|-------------|----------|
| I1          | Math     |
| I1          | Physics  |
| I2          | Physics  |
| I3          | Chemistry |

**Fix:**  
- Removes multi-valued dependency.

---

### **5th Normal Form (5NF) – Eliminate Redundant Joins:**  
Ensuring no redundant joins in many-to-many relationships.

**Final Tables:**
- **Students**
- **Courses**
- **Student-Course**
- **Instructors**
- **Course-Instructor**
- **Instructor-Subjects**

---

In MySQL and data warehousing, **dimension tables** and **fact tables** are essential components of a **star schema** or **snowflake schema** used in analytical databases.

---

### **1. Fact Table**
A fact table contains measurable data (facts) related to business processes and transactions. It typically consists of **foreign keys** linking to dimension tables and **metrics or numeric values** (aggregatable data).

#### **Example Fact Table: `SalesFact`**
| SaleID | DateID | ProductID | CustomerID | SalesAmount |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 1      | 20250101 | 101      | 201        | 500         |
| 2      | 20250102 | 102      | 202        | 750         |
| 3      | 20250102 | 101      | 203        | 200         |

🔹 **Columns Breakdown:**
- **SaleID:** Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **DateID:** Foreign key to the date dimension table.
- **ProductID:** Foreign key to the product dimension table.
- **CustomerID:** Foreign key to the customer dimension table.
- **SalesAmount:** Measurable fact (business metric).

---

### **2. Dimension Table**
Dimension tables provide descriptive attributes that define the details of a fact table. They store categorical data used for slicing and dicing the fact table.

#### **Example Dimension Table: `ProductDimension`**
| ProductID | ProductName | Category   | Price |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------|
| 101       | Laptop     | Electronics | 1000 |
| 102       | Phone      | Electronics | 700  |
| 103       | Watch      | Accessories | 200  |

🔹 **Columns Breakdown:**
- **ProductID:** Unique identifier (Primary Key).
- **ProductName:** Descriptive attribute.
- **Category:** Categorical grouping.
- **Price:** Static product price.

---

### **Key Differences Between Fact and Dimension Tables**
| Feature       | Fact Table       | Dimension Table    |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | Stores measurable data | Stores descriptive data |
| **Size** | Large (high number of rows) | Smaller (less frequently updated) |
| **Keys** | Contains foreign keys | Contains primary keys |
| **Examples** | Sales, Revenue, Inventory | Product, Customer, Time |

---

### **Usage in MySQL**
1. **Fact tables** help in reporting total sales, revenue, and performance trends.
2. **Dimension tables** enable filtering, grouping, and categorizing reports.

In MySQL, **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** refer to handling historical changes in dimension data within a database. This concept is crucial in **data warehousing** because business entities (like customers, products, employees) undergo changes over time. Maintaining accurate historical records ensures better analytics and reporting.

### **Types of SCD:**
There are mainly **three types** of Slowly Changing Dimensions:

#### **1. SCD Type 1 – Overwrite the Data**
- Old data is simply **updated** with new values.
- No history is maintained.
- Used when tracking changes isn't necessary.

##### **Example Table Before Update:**
| CustomerID | Name  | City   |
|------------|------|--------|
| 101        | Alice | Delhi  |

##### **After Update (Overwrite the Record):**
| CustomerID | Name  | City     |
|------------|------|--------|
| 101        | Alice | Mumbai  |

🔹 **Drawback:** Loss of historical information.

---

#### **2. SCD Type 2 – Maintain Full History**
- Old records are retained, and a **new row** is inserted for changes.
- A `StartDate` and `EndDate` column tracks changes over time.
- This method is used when historical tracking is important.

##### **Example Table Before Change:**
| CustomerID | Name  | City   | StartDate  | EndDate  |
|------------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| 101        | Alice | Delhi  | 2025-01-01 | NULL     |

##### **After Change (New Record Added):**
| CustomerID | Name  | City     | StartDate  | EndDate  |
|------------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| 101        | Alice | Delhi   | 2025-01-01 | 2025-06-01 |
| 102        | Alice | Mumbai  | 2025-06-02 | NULL       |

🔹 **Advantage:** Preserves historical data for better tracking.

---

#### **3. SCD Type 3 – Track Limited History**
- Old data is stored in a **"previous value"** column.
- The table keeps only **one previous state** instead of a full history.

##### **Example Table Before Change:**
| CustomerID | Name  | CurrentCity | PreviousCity |
|------------|------|------------|--------------|
| 101        | Alice | Delhi       | NULL        |

##### **After Change (Column Updated):**
| CustomerID | Name  | CurrentCity | PreviousCity |
|------------|------|------------|--------------|
| 101        | Alice | Mumbai      | Delhi        |

🔹 **Best Use Case:** If only recent change tracking is needed.

---

### **Choosing the Right SCD Type**
- ✅ **Type 1**: When historical changes are NOT important.
- ✅ **Type 2**: When full change history is required.
- ✅ **Type 3**: When only the last change matters.

The **ACID** concept in MySQL stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**, which are the key properties that ensure reliable database transactions. These properties help maintain data integrity even in cases of system failures or concurrent access.

### **1. Atomicity (All or Nothing)**
- Ensures that a transaction is **either fully completed or fully rolled back**.
- If any part of the transaction fails, MySQL **undoes** all changes to keep data consistent.
- Example: Transferring money between two accounts should either **complete** or **not happen at all**—it must not end in an incomplete state.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT; -- Ensures changes are saved
ROLLBACK; -- Undo if an error occurs
```

---

### **2. Consistency (Valid State Transitions)**
- Ensures that a transaction **maintains database integrity** before and after execution.
- If the database starts in a **valid state**, it must remain valid after the transaction.

Example: A foreign key constraint ensures that **no orphaned records exist**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

---

### **3. Isolation (Independent Transactions)**
- Ensures transactions **do not interfere with each other**, preventing data inconsistencies.
- MySQL provides **Isolation Levels** to control how transactions see changes made by others:
  - **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Can see uncommitted changes.
  - **READ COMMITTED**: Only sees committed changes.
  - **REPEATABLE READ** (default in MySQL): Ensures same data is read during a transaction.
  - **SERIALIZABLE**: Strictest isolation, prevents concurrent changes.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
-- The balance won't change even if another transaction modifies it until this transaction completes.
COMMIT;
```

---

### **4. Durability (Permanent Changes)**
- Ensures **committed transactions** are permanently stored—even if the system crashes.
- MySQL uses techniques like **logs, write-ahead logging, and backups** for durability.

Example: InnoDB's redo log ensures data is stored safely.

```sql
SHOW ENGINES; -- InnoDB supports ACID
```

---

### **Why is ACID Important?**
- Prevents data corruption and loss.
- Ensures **reliable transactions** for banking, e-commerce, and critical applications.
- Helps maintain **consistency and stability** in multi-user environments.

Would you like an example of how a MySQL transaction maintains ACID properties in a real-world scenario? 😊
