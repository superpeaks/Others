    "1.  **Theory First, Then Practice:** Understand *what* a keyword does before trying to use it.\n",
    "2.  **Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on:** This is non-negotiable. Set up a MySQL server (using XAMPP, Docker, or a cloud instance). Create your own simple databases (e.g., `employees`, `products`, `orders`).\n",
    "3.  **Start Simple:** Don't jump to complex queries. Master `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` thoroughly.\n",
    "4.  **Gradual Complexity:** Introduce joins, then subqueries, then window functions. Each builds on the last.\n",
    "5.  **Small Datasets:** Work with small, manageable datasets initially to easily verify your results.\n",
    "6.  **Read Error Messages:** They are your best friends for debugging.\n",
    "7.  **Official Documentation:** The MySQL documentation is the ultimate source of truth.\n",
    "8.  **Online Resources:** Websites like W3Schools, SQLBolt, HackerRank, LeetCode (for SQL) offer great exercises.\n",
