You are asking for detailed examples for each of the tree types we've discussed: Binary Tree, BST, AVL, B-Tree, and Trie. Here's a breakdown with a focus on practical examples and common scenarios.

## 1\. Binary Tree

A binary tree is a general-purpose tree where each node can have up to two children. It doesn't have the specific ordering of a BST.

**Example: Expression Tree**
An expression tree represents an arithmetic expression. Leaf nodes are operands (numbers), and internal nodes are operators.

**Traversal Examples**
Let's use this tree for our traversals:

```
       +
      / \
     3   *
        / \
       4   5
```

  * **In-order**: `3 + 4 * 5`. The numbers and operators are arranged in the order of the expression.
  * **Pre-order**: `+ 3 * 4 5`. This is a prefix expression.
  * **Post-order**: `3 4 5 * +`. This is a postfix expression (Reverse Polish Notation).

## 2\. Binary Search Tree (BST)

A BST is a binary tree with the property that all nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the root, and all nodes in the right subtree are larger.

**Example: Phonebook**
Imagine a simplified phonebook where you store names and phone numbers. If you organize this data in a BST by name, finding a specific name is very fast.

**Operations Example**
Let's build a BST and perform operations:

1.  **Insert 8**: `[8]`
2.  **Insert 3**: `3 < 8`, so it goes to the left. `[3, 8]`
3.  **Insert 10**: `10 > 8`, so it goes to the right. `[3, 8, 10]`
4.  **Insert 1**: `1 < 8` (left), `1 < 3` (left). `[1, 3, 8, 10]`
5.  **Insert 6**: `6 < 8` (left), `6 > 3` (right). `[1, 3, 6, 8, 10]`

The tree now looks like this:

```
       8
      / \
     3   10
    / \
   1   6
```

To **search for 6**, you start at the root (8). Since `6 < 8`, you go left. At the next node (3), `6 > 3`, so you go right. You find 6. The search path is much shorter than checking every node.

-----

## 3\. AVL Trees

An AVL tree is a self-balancing BST. It ensures the tree remains balanced by performing rotations after insertions or deletions.

**Example: A Self-Balancing Dictionary**
An AVL tree is a good choice for a dictionary or symbol table where you expect frequent insertions and deletions but need guaranteed fast lookups.

**Balancing Example**
Consider inserting `10, 20, 30` into an empty AVL tree.

1.  **Insert 10**: The tree is balanced. `[10]`
2.  **Insert 20**: The tree is still balanced. `[10, 20]`
3.  **Insert 30**: The tree becomes unbalanced at node `10` (the balance factor is -2).
      * `[10, 20, 30]`
      * To fix this, the tree performs a **left rotation** at the root (`10`). `20` becomes the new root, and `10` becomes its left child.
4.  The final, balanced tree:
    ```
      20
     /  \
    10   30
    ```

This guarantees all operations remain $O(\\log n)$, unlike a regular BST which can degrade to $O(n)$ in the worst case.

-----

## 4\. B-Trees

B-Trees are optimized for disk-based data storage, where reading a block of data is a slow but necessary operation. A single B-Tree node can hold many keys and children.

**Example: Database Indexing**
A database uses a B-Tree to create an index on a column. This index allows the database to find specific rows very quickly without scanning the entire table on disk.

  * Imagine a table with millions of records. Searching for a specific record by ID would take forever.
  * A B-Tree index on the ID column allows the database to read just a few blocks from the disk to navigate the tree and find the exact location of the record. Each node in the B-Tree corresponds to a block on the disk.

This structure is shallow and wide, minimizing the number of disk reads, which is the most expensive operation.

-----

## 5\. Trie (Prefix Tree)

A Trie is a tree structure used for storing strings. Each path from the root to a node represents a prefix, and the nodes themselves don't store the full word, but rather a character.

**Example: Autocomplete**
When you type "app" into a search bar, a Trie is used to quickly suggest "apple," "application," and "apply."

**How it works:**

1.  The root is an empty string.
2.  The first character of your input (`a`) takes you to a child node representing 'a'.
3.  The next character (`p`) takes you to a child of 'a' representing 'p'.
4.  The next character (`p`) takes you to a child of 'p' representing 'p'.
5.  Now, from this node, you can traverse all sub-trees to find every word that starts with "app."

**Example Trie for words `["apple", "apply", "app"]`**

```
  (root)
    |
    a
    |
    p
    |
    p (end_of_word)
    | \
    l  l
    |  |
    e  y
 (end_of_word)
```

A search for "app" stops at the `p` node, and the algorithm can then recursively find all valid words from that point. This makes prefix-based searching incredibly fast, typically $O(L)$, where $L$ is the length of the prefix.


It appears you want to regenerate the previous responses about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python, but this time with actual, runnable Python code examples for each topic. I'll provide a detailed breakdown for each data structure with practical code implementations.

### 1\. Arrays (Lists in Python)

Python lists serve as dynamic arrays. They are mutable and can hold a collection of items.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
# Initialization
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(f"Initial list: {my_list}")

# Accessing elements
print(f"Element at index 0: {my_list[0]}") # O(1)
print(f"Last element: {my_list[-1]}")

# Insertion
# At the end (efficient)
my_list.append(60) # O(1) amortized
print(f"After appending 60: {my_list}")

# At a specific index (inefficient)
my_list.insert(1, 15) # O(n)
print(f"After inserting 15 at index 1: {my_list}")

# Deletion
# By index (inefficient)
del my_list[2] # Deletes 20. O(n)
print(f"After deleting element at index 2: {my_list}")

# By value (inefficient)
my_list.remove(40) # Removes the first occurrence of 40. O(n)
print(f"After removing value 40: {my_list}")

# Multi-dimensional list
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(f"Multi-dimensional list: {matrix}")
print(f"Accessing element at [1][0]: {matrix[1][0]}")
```

-----

### 2\. Strings

Strings are immutable sequences of characters. Any operation that modifies a string returns a new string.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
# Slicing
s = "Hello World"
print(f"Original string: '{s}'")
print(f"Slice from index 6: '{s[6:]}'") # 'World'
print(f"Reversed string: '{s[::-1]}'") # 'dlroW olleH'

# Concatenation
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "Python"
s3 = s1 + " " + s2
print(f"Concatenated string: '{s3}'")

# String searching
s_long = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
print(f"'fox' is in the string: {'fox' in s_long}") # True
print(f"Index of 'quick': {s_long.find('quick')}") # 4

# String methods
s_case = "pythoN"
print(f"Uppercase: '{s_case.upper()}'")
s_whitespace = "  some text  "
print(f"Stripped: '{s_whitespace.strip()}'")
```

-----

### 3\. Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    def traverse(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

    def reverse(self):
        prev = None
        current = self.head
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node
        self.head = prev

# Example usage
llist = LinkedList()
llist.insert_at_beginning(30)
llist.insert_at_beginning(20)
llist.insert_at_beginning(10)
print("Original list:")
llist.traverse() # Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> None

llist.reverse()
print("Reversed list:")
llist.traverse() # Output: 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> None
```

-----

### 4\. Stacks

A stack is a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure. Python's `list` is an efficient choice for a stack.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
# Using Python's list as a stack
stack = []

# Push operation (append)
stack.append('A')
stack.append('B')
stack.append('C')
print(f"Stack after pushes: {stack}") # ['A', 'B', 'C']

# Pop operation
popped_item = stack.pop()
print(f"Popped item: {popped_item}") # 'C'
print(f"Stack after pop: {stack}") # ['A', 'B']

# Peek (accessing the top element)
if stack:
    peek_item = stack[-1]
    print(f"Top element (peek): {peek_item}") # 'B'

# Balancing parentheses problem example
def is_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping.keys():
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return not stack

print(f"'{'{[()]}'' is balanced: {is_balanced('{[()]}')}") # True
print(f"'{'{[(])}'' is balanced: {is_balanced('{[(])}')}") # False
```

-----

### 5\. Queues

A queue is a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure. `collections.deque` is the most efficient queue implementation in Python.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
from collections import deque

# Using deque as a queue
queue = deque()

# Enqueue operation (append)
queue.append('A')
queue.append('B')
queue.append('C')
print(f"Queue after enqueues: {queue}") # deque(['A', 'B', 'C'])

# Dequeue operation (popleft)
dequeued_item = queue.popleft()
print(f"Dequeued item: {dequeued_item}") # 'A'
print(f"Queue after dequeue: {queue}") # deque(['B', 'C'])

# Peek (accessing the front element)
if queue:
    peek_item = queue[0]
    print(f"Front element (peek): {peek_item}") # 'B'
```

-----

### 6\. Hashing

Hashing involves using a hash function to map keys to array indices. Python's `dict` and `set` are implemented using hash tables.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
# Dictionaries (Hash Maps)
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(f"Dictionary: {my_dict}")

# Insertion and lookup are O(1) on average
my_dict["city"] = "New York"
print(f"Value for 'age': {my_dict['age']}")

# Sets (Hash Sets)
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
print(f"Set: {my_set}") # {1, 2, 3}

# Membership test is O(1) on average
print(f"Is 2 in the set? {2 in my_set}") # True
```

-----

### 7\. Trees

Here are code examples for a basic Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST) to demonstrate the core concepts.

#### **Python Code Example**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Binary Tree Traversal
def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)
        print(root.key, end=" ")
        inorder_traversal(root.right)

# Creating a simple binary tree
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
root.left.left = Node(4)
root.left.right = Node(5)

print("In-order traversal of binary tree:")
inorder_traversal(root) # Output: 4 2 5 1 3

# Binary Search Tree (BST) insertion
def insert_bst(root, key):
    if root is None:
        return Node(key)
    if key < root.key:
        root.left = insert_bst(root.left, key)
    else:
        root.right = insert_bst(root.right, key)
    return root

bst_root = None
keys = [8, 3, 10, 1, 6, 14]
for key in keys:
    bst_root = insert_bst(bst_root, key)

print("\n\nIn-order traversal of BST (sorted):")
inorder_traversal(bst_root) # Output: 1 3 6 8 10 14
```
