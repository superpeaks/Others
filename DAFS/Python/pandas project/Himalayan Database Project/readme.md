# Data Visualization of Himalayan Climbing Trends

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Himalayan climbing trends from 2000 to 2024 using real expedition data. It explores the number of climbers, their age and gender, countries of origin, and the highest points reached. The study also examines death rates, causes of death, and patterns over the years.

Visualizations help to understand the risks and achievements of climbers, as well as demographic patterns. The goal is to provide clear insights into the challenges and successes of Himalayan expeditions, making the data easy to understand for everyone interested in mountaineering and mountain safety.

## Key Insights

* Most climbers fall within the 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 age categories.
* Male climbers significantly outnumber female climbers, but female participation is gradually increasing.
* The majority of successful ascents to the highest point (8849 m, Everest) are concentrated among a few countries, with Nepal, China, and the USA leading.
* Deaths are most frequent at altitudes above 8000 m, which is considered the highest risk area.
* The main causes of death are falls, avalanches, exhaustion, and altitude-related illnesses (AMS).
* The death rate is approximately 2 to 4% every year, while the success rate is increasing year by year.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (`himalayan_database.ipynb`) which includes data import, exploration, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy plotly seaborn xlrd openpyxl nbformat
    ```
3.  Open the `himalayan_database.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter.
4.  Run all cells to see the analysis and visualizations.
