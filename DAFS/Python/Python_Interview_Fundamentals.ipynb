        "  * **What is Python?**\n",
        "      * Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "  * **Why is Python an interpreted language?**\n",
        "      * Python is an interpreted language because its source code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This makes development faster as you can run and test code immediately.\n",
        "  * **Explain Dynamic typed language**\n",
        "      * In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time. You don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable; the interpreter infers the type based on the assigned value.\n",
        "  * **Features of Python**\n",
        "      * Some key features of Python include:\n",
        "          * **Readability:** Python emphasizes code readability.\n",
        "          * **Simple Syntax:** Python has a relatively simple and easy-to-learn syntax.\n",
        "          * **Large Standard Library:** Python has a rich standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks.\n",
        "          * **Cross-platform compatibility:** Python runs on various operating systems.\n",
        "          * **Dynamically Typed:** As explained above, Python is dynamically typed.\n",
        "          * **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line.\n",
        "          * **Object-Oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming.\n",
        "  * **What are the keywords?**\n",
        "      * Python keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes in the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `return`, `yield`, etc.\n",
        "  * **Difference between identifier and variable**\n",
        "      * An **identifier** is a name given to an entity like a variable, function, class, etc. It's a way to refer to that entity in your code. A **variable** is a specific type of identifier that is used to store a data value. So, all variables are identifiers, but not all identifiers are variables (e.g., function names are identifiers but not variables).\n",
        "  * **Explain datatypes.**\n",
        "      * Data types are classifications of data items. They represent the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on that particular value. Python has several built-in data types:\n",
        "          * **Numeric Types:** `int` (integers), `float` (floating-point numbers), `complex` (complex numbers)\n",
        "          * **Text Type:** `str` (string)\n",
        "          * **Sequence Types:** `list`, `tuple`, `range`\n",
        "          * **Mapping Type:** `dict` (dictionary)\n",
        "          * **Set Types:** `set`, `frozenset`\n",
        "          * **Boolean Type:** `bool` (True or False)\n",
        "          * **Binary Types:** `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`\n",
        "  * **What is Python Dictionary.**\n",
        "      * A Python dictionary is a built-in data type that stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique within a dictionary, and it is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.\n",
        "  * **Difference between tuple and list**\n",
        "      * Both tuples and lists are sequence data types in Python:\n",
        "          * **List:** Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements (add, remove, or modify). Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`.\n",
        "          * **Tuple:** Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their elements after they are created. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.\n",
        "  * **Explain string and its methods.**\n",
        "      * A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable in Python. Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate strings, such as:\n",
        "          * `len()`: Returns the length of the string.\n",
        "          * `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase.\n",
        "          * `upper()`: Converts the string to uppercase.\n",
        "          * `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespaces.\n",
        "          * `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings.\n",
        "          * `find()`: Searches for a substring.\n",
        "          * `replace()`: Replaces a substring with another string.\n",
        "  * **Difference between indexing and slicing.**\n",
        "      * **Indexing:** Indexing is used to access a single element of a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) using its position (index). Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0.\n",
        "      * **Slicing:** Slicing is used to access a sequence of elements from a sequence. You can specify a range of indices to extract a portion of the sequence.\n",
        "  * **Difference between append and extend.**\n",
        "      * Both `append()` and `extend()` are list methods:\n",
        "          * `append()`: Adds a single element to the end of the list. The element can be of any data type.\n",
        "          * `extend()`: Adds the elements of another iterable (like another list, tuple, or string) to the end of the list.\n",
        "  * **Difference between index and indexing.**\n",
        "      * `index()`: This is a list method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the list.\n",
        "      * `Indexing`: This is the general process of accessing an element in a sequence (string, list, tuple) using its position (index).\n",
        "  * **Difference between individual and collection datatype.**\n",
        "      * **Individual Datatype:** These data types can hold only a single value. Examples include `int`, `float`, `string`, and `bool`.\n",
        "      * **Collection Datatype:** These data types can hold multiple values. Examples include `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, and `set`.\n",
        "  * **What is indentation.**\n",
        "      * Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. In Python, indentation is crucial for defining the structure of the code and indicating blocks of code (e.g., within loops, conditional statements, and function definitions). Consistent indentation is essential for Python code to be syntactically correct.\n",
        "  * **What is shallow copy and deep copy.**\n",
        "      * These concepts relate to copying objects (especially mutable objects like lists and dictionaries):\n",
        "          * **Shallow Copy:** Creates a new object but copies references to the objects contained in the original object. If you modify a nested object in the copied object, the original object is also affected.\n",
        "          * **Deep Copy:** Creates a new object and recursively copies all the objects found in the original object. If you modify a nested object in the copied object, the original object remains unchanged.\n",
        "  * **What is remove, del and pop.**\n",
        "      * These are ways to delete elements from lists or dictionaries:\n",
        "          * `remove()`: A list method that removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.\n",
        "          * `del`: A keyword that can delete an element at a specific index in a list or delete a key-value pair from a dictionary. It can also delete the entire variable.\n",
        "          * `pop()`: A list method that removes and returns the element at a specific index. If no index is given, it removes and returns the last element. For dictionaries, `pop()` removes and returns the value associated with a given key.\n",
        "  * **Explain modification of dictionary and list.**\n",
        "      * **List Modification:**\n",
        "          * Adding elements: `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`\n",
        "          * Removing elements: `remove()`, `pop()`, `del`\n",
        "          * Changing elements: Assigning a new value to an element using its index.\n",
        "      * **Dictionary Modification:**\n",
        "          * Adding key-value pairs: Assigning a value to a new key.\n",
        "          * Updating values: Assigning a new value to an existing key.\n",
        "          * Removing key-value pairs: `pop()`, `del`, `popitem()`, `clear()`\n",
        "  * **What is operators.**\n",
        "      * Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands (values or variables). Python has various types of operators:\n",
        "          * Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation)\n",
        "          * Comparison operators: `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
        "          * Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
        "          * Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=` , `**=`\n",
        "          * Bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`\n",
        "          * Membership operators: `in`, `not in`\n",
        "          * Identity operators: `is`, `is not`\n",
        "  * **What is membership and logical operators.**\n",
        "      * **Membership Operators:** Used to test if a sequence is present in an object:\n",
        "          * `in`: Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.\n",
        "          * `not in`: Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object.\n",
        "      * **Logical Operators:** Used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "          * `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true.\n",
        "          * `or`: Returns `True` if at least one of the statements is true.\n",
        "          * `not`: Reverses the result; returns `False` if the result is true, and `True` if the result is false.\n",
        "  * **What is input and output statements.**\n",
        "      * **Input Statements:** Used to get data from the user. In Python, the `input()` function is used for this purpose.\n",
        "      * **Output Statements:** Used to display data to the user. In Python, the `print()` function is used for this purpose.\n",
        "  * **What is control statements (conditional and looping)**\n",
        "      * Control statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program.\n",
        "          * **Conditional Statements:** Used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. Python uses `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` statements.\n",
        "          * **Looping Statements:** Used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python has `for` and `while` loops.\n",
        "  * **Difference between while loop and for loop**\n",
        "      * **For Loop:** Typically used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate (e.g., iterating through a list or a range).\n",
        "      * **While Loop:** Used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true, and you may not know the number of iterations beforehand.\n",
        "  * **Loop control statements (break, continue and pass)**\n",
        "      * These statements are used to alter the normal flow of a loop:\n",
        "          * `break`: Terminates the loop and the program control resumes to the statement immediately following the loop.\n",
        "          * `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop.\n",
        "          * `pass`: A null statement. It is used as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.\n",
        "  * **What is comprehension.**\n",
        "      * Comprehensions provide a concise way to create new sequences (like lists, sets, or dictionaries) based on existing sequences. They are a syntactic construct to create a sequence from another sequence.\n",
        "  * **What is recursion**\n",
        "      * Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. Recursive functions solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.\n",
        "  * **Explain Functions.**\n",
        "      * A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help to modularize code, making it more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Functions and Arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Explain type of arguments**\n",
        "      * In Python, you can pass arguments to a function in different ways:\n",
        "          * **Positional Arguments:** Arguments are passed in the order they are defined in the function definition.\n",
        "          * **Keyword Arguments:** Arguments are passed using the parameter name along with the value (e.g., `func(name=\"John\", age=30)`). This allows you to pass arguments in any order.\n",
        "          * **Default Arguments:** Parameters can have default values. If the caller doesn't provide a value for a parameter with a default, the default value is used.\n",
        "          * **Variable-length Arguments:**\n",
        "              * `*args`: Used to pass a variable number of positional arguments.\n",
        "              * `**kwargs`: Used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",
        "  * **Explain scopes.**\n",
        "      * A scope defines the region where a variable is accessible. Python has the following scopes:\n",
        "          * **Local Scope:** Variables defined inside a function have local scope and are accessible only within that function.\n",
        "          * **Global Scope:** Variables defined outside any function have global scope and are accessible from anywhere in the program.\n",
        "          * **Enclosing Scope:** If a function is nested inside another function, the variables in the outer function are in the enclosing scope of the inner function.\n",
        "          * **Built-in Scope:** This scope contains built-in names like functions (`print()`, `len()`) and exceptions.\n",
        "  * **Explain default parameter and annotations.**\n",
        "      * **Default Parameter:** A default parameter is a parameter in a function definition that has a default value. If a value is not provided for that parameter when the function is called, the default value is used.\n",
        "      * **Annotations:** Annotations are metadata that provide information about the types of parameters and return values of a function. They are written using the colon `:` syntax for parameters and the `->` syntax for the return value (e.g., `def func(param: int) -> str:`). Annotations are used for documentation and type checking.\n",
        "  * **Explain Generators.**\n",
        "      * Generators are a type of function that returns an iterator. They use the `yield` keyword to produce a series of values, one at a time. Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on the fly, only when needed, rather than storing an entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "  * **Explain difference between return and yield keywords.**\n",
        "      * `return`: The `return` statement terminates the execution of a function and returns a value to the caller. After a `return` statement, the function ends.\n",
        "      * `yield`: The `yield` keyword is used in generator functions. Instead of terminating, `yield` temporarily suspends the function's execution and returns a value to the caller. The function's state is saved, so it can be resumed later from where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exception Handling and Decorators**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Explain exception handling.**\n",
        "      * Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events that occur during the execution of a program. Python provides `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks to handle exceptions.\n",
        "  * **What is raise keyword.**\n",
        "      * The `raise` keyword is used to explicitly raise an exception. You can raise built-in exceptions or custom exceptions.\n",
        "  * **What is Decorator and explain decorator.**\n",
        "      * A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it, and returns the modified function. Decorators provide a way to add functionality (like logging, access control, or caching) to functions in a reusable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**File Handling and Built-in Features**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **What is file and file handling.**\n",
        "      * A file is a named location on disk used to store related information. File handling is the process of reading from and writing to files. Python provides built-in functions to perform file operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing files.\n",
        "  * **What is type casting.**\n",
        "      * Type casting (or type conversion) is the process of converting data of one type to another type. Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, `set()`, and `dict()`.\n",
        "  * **List all the inbuilt functions.**\n",
        "      * Python has a large number of built-in functions. Here are a few common ones:\n",
        "          * `print()`\n",
        "          * `len()`\n",
        "          * `type()`\n",
        "          * `int()`\n",

        "          * `bool()`\n",
        "          * `list()`\n",
        "          * `tuple()`\n",

        "          * `min()`\n",
        "          * `max()`\n",
        "  * **What is lambda, map & filter.**\n",
        "      * `lambda`: A `lambda` function is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.\n",
        "      * `map`: The `map()` function applies a given function to all items of an input iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator that yields the results.\n",
        "      * `filter`: The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from those elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
        "  * **Explain pickling and unpickling.**\n",
        "      * Pickling is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream. Unpickling is the reverse process, converting a byte stream back into a Python object. The `pickle` module in Python is used for this purpose. It is used to serialize and deserialize Python object structures.\n",
