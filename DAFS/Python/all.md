## **Part 1 – Core Python Basics**

---

### **Q1. What are Python’s main features? Why is it popular in data analytics?**

**Explanation:**
Python is a **high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed** programming language.
It’s popular in data analytics because:

1. **Easy to learn** – Syntax is simple and similar to English.
2. **Rich ecosystem** – Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
3. **Cross-platform** – Works on Windows, macOS, Linux.
4. **Interpreted** – No compilation needed.
5. **Large community** – Quick help and open-source support.
6. **Integration** – Works with SQL, Excel, APIs, big data tools.

**Code Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'],
    'Score': [85, 90, 78]
})

avg_score = data['Score'].mean()
print("Average Score:", avg_score)
```

**Interview Tip:**
Highlight **libraries**, **productivity**, and **integration** in your answer.

---

### **Q2. Explain Python’s data types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set).**

**Data Types Table:**

| Type  | Description        | Example                      |
| ----- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| int   | Whole numbers      | `x = 5`                      |
| float | Decimal numbers    | `y = 3.14`                   |
| str   | Text               | `"Hello"`                    |
| list  | Ordered, mutable   | `[1, 2, 3]`                  |
| tuple | Ordered, immutable | `(1, 2, 3)`                  |
| dict  | Key-value pairs    | `{"name": "Raj", "age": 25}` |
| set   | Unique items       | `{1, 2, 3}`                  |

**Code Example:**

```python
age = 25
pi = 3.14
name = "Rajesh"
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
person = {"name": "Rajesh", "age": 25}
unique_nums = {1, 2, 2, 3}  # duplicates removed

print(type(person), type(unique_nums))
```

**Interview Tip:**
Be ready to **mention mutability** of each type.

---

### **Q3. Difference between mutable and immutable data types.**

**Mutable:** Can change after creation (list, dict, set).
**Immutable:** Cannot change after creation (int, float, str, tuple).

**Code Example:**

```python
# Mutable
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums.append(4)
print(nums)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Immutable
name = "John"
new_name = name.replace("J", "K")
print(name)       # John (unchanged)
print(new_name)   # Kohn
```

**Interview Tip:**
Mention that immutable objects can be used as **dictionary keys** or in **sets**.

---

### **Q4. What is type casting in Python? Give examples.**

**Explanation:**
Type casting converts one data type to another.

**Two types:**

* **Implicit casting** – Done automatically.
* **Explicit casting** – Done manually using functions.

**Code Example:**

```python
# Implicit
x = 5       # int
y = 2.0     # float
z = x + y   # float (automatic conversion)

# Explicit
a = int("10")   # string to int
b = float(5)    # int to float
c = str(3.14)   # float to string

print(z, type(z))
print(a, b, c)
```

---

### **Q5. Difference between `==` and `is` operators.**

**`==`** → Compares **values**.
**`is`** → Compares **object identity** (memory location).

**Code Example:**

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

print(x == y)  # True (values same)
print(x is y)  # False (different memory locations)

a = b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is b)  # True (same memory)
```

### **Q6. Explain Python’s memory management.**

**Explanation:**

* Python uses **automatic memory management** via **reference counting** and **garbage collection**.
* **Reference counting:** Keeps track of the number of references to an object.
* **Garbage collector:** Removes unused objects from memory.

**Code Example:**

```python
import sys

x = [1, 2, 3]
print(sys.getrefcount(x))  # shows number of references to x
```

**Interview Tip:**
Mention that Python uses a **private heap** and **generational garbage collection**.

---

### **Q7. What are Python’s keywords?**

* Reserved words in Python that have special meaning.
* Cannot be used as variable names.

**Example List:**
`and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `def`, `try`, `except`, `with`, `lambda`, etc.

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

---

### **Q8. What are Python’s operators?**

* Assignment: `= += -= *= /=`
* Membership: `in`, `not in`
* Identity: `is`, `is not`

---

### **Q9. What is indentation in Python and why is it important?**

**Explanation:**

* Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of `{}`.
* Wrong indentation → `IndentationError`.

```python
if True:
    print("Indented block")
```

---
