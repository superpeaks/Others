| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boolean**    | Stores a `True` or `False` value.                                                               | `Dim flag As Boolean`<br> `flag = True`                                    |
| **Byte**       | Stores an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255).                                                    | `Dim num As Byte`<br> `num = 255`                                          |

| **Single**     | Stores a single-precision floating-point number (-3.4E+38 to 3.4E+38).                          | `Dim s As Single`<br> `s = 3.14`                                           |
| **Double**     | Stores a double-precision floating-point number (-1.8E+308 to 1.8E+308).                        | `Dim d As Double`<br> `d = 3.14159`                                        |
| **Currency**   | Stores a fixed-point number with up to four decimal places (8-byte).                            | `Dim c As Currency`<br> `c = 19.99`                                        |
| **Date**       | Stores a date or time value. (Range: 1 Jan 100 to 31 Dec 9999).                                 | `Dim dt As Date`<br> `dt = #1/1/2023#`                                     |
| **String**     | Stores a sequence of characters (up to 2 billion characters).                                   | `Dim str As String`<br> `str = "Hello World"`                              |
| **Object**     | Stores a reference to an object (e.g., Worksheet, Range, Workbook).                             | `Dim ws As Worksheet`<br> `Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1)`                |
| **Variant**    | A special data type that can hold any type of data (automatically used if no type is declared). | `Dim v As Variant`<br> `v = "Hello"`                                       |
| **Error**      | Stores a numeric error value (e.g., `Err.Number` can store an error code).                      | `Dim err As Error`<br> `Set err = Err`                                     |
| **Empty**      | Represents an uninitialized variable.                                                           | `Dim e As Variant`<br> `e = Empty`                                         |
| **Null**       | Represents a missing or undefined value (commonly used with databases).                         | `Dim n As Variant`<br> `n = Null`                                          |
| **Collection** | A special data type for creating a collection of objects or values.                             | `Dim coll As Collection`<br> `Set coll = New Collection`                   |
| **Dictionary** | A data structure that stores key-value pairs, commonly used for quick lookups.                  | `Dim dict As Object`<br> `Set dict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")` |

### Notes:

* **Boolean**: Used for logic (True/False).
* **Byte**: Good for working with small integer values (like indices).
* **Integer**: For small whole numbers.
* **Long**: Used for larger whole numbers.
* **Single**: For single-precision floating-point numbers, typically for lower-precision calculations.
* **Double**: For higher-precision floating-point calculations.
* **Currency**: Used for financial calculations where accuracy to four decimal places is needed.
* **Date**: Used for handling dates and times.
* **String**: Used to store sequences of characters.
* **Object**: Stores references to objects such as workbooks, worksheets, or ranges.
* **Variant**: Flexible; stores any data type, but not as efficient as using a more specific type.
* **Error**: Handles error codes generated by VBA.
* **Empty**: Indicates an uninitialized variable (not assigned a value yet).
* **Null**: Often used to represent an unknown or missing value, especially when working with databases.
* **Collection**: A simple object that can store an unordered collection of items (useful for dynamically adding items).
* **Dictionary**: Provides key-value pairs and is part of the `Scripting` runtime.
