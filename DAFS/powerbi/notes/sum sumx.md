Notice that `SUM(Revenue)` and `SUMX(Table, Revenue)` often return the same result‚Äî**but only when you're summing a single column without any row-level logic or filtering**. So when should you choose a different DAX function? Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### ‚úÖ When `SUM` Is Enough
Use `SUM(Revenue)` when:
- You're simply aggregating a column.
- No row-by-row calculation is needed.
- No complex filters or expressions are involved.

It‚Äôs faster and more efficient because it belongs to the **aggregator engine**.

---

### üîÅ When to Use `SUMX`
Use `SUMX(Table, Revenue)` when:
- You need to **iterate** over rows.
- You're applying **row-level filters** or logic.
- You're summing **expressions**, not just columns.

Example:
```dax
SUMX(FILTER(Sales, Sales[Region] = "East"), Sales[Revenue])
```
This filters the table before summing‚Äîsomething `SUM` can‚Äôt do directly.

---

### üß† When to Choose a Different Function

If `SUM` and `SUMX` give the same result, but you want to:
- **Apply filters** ‚Üí use `CALCULATE(SUM(...))`
- **Sum a calculated expression** ‚Üí use `SUMX(...)`
- **Aggregate with conditions** ‚Üí use `CALCULATE(SUM(...), FILTER(...))`
- **Compare totals across time** ‚Üí use `TOTALYTD`, `TOTALMTD`, etc.
- **Create dynamic logic** ‚Üí use `VAR` with `SUMX` or `CALCULATE`

---

### üîç Example: Weighted Revenue

```dax
SUMX(Sales, Sales[Revenue] * Sales[Weight])
```

This can‚Äôt be done with `SUM` alone‚Äîyou need `SUMX` to evaluate the expression row-by-row.

---

So if your current formula is too simple to justify `SUMX`, stick with `SUM`. But if you're planning to add filters, expressions, or logic‚Äî**that‚Äôs your cue to switch to `SUMX` or `CALCULATE`**.

**In many cases, yes, `SUM` inside `CALCULATE` is perfectly fine** and even preferred for performance. But let‚Äôs unpack when `SUMX` might still be necessary.

---

### ‚úÖ When `SUM` Works Inside `CALCULATE`

If you're simply summing a column with filters, this is ideal:

```dax
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Revenue]),
    Sales[Channel] = "Wholesale"
)
```

- Efficient and readable
- Uses the **aggregator engine**
- No row-by-row logic needed

---

### üîÅ When You Might Need `SUMX` Inside `CALCULATE`

Use `SUMX` if:
- You're summing a **calculated expression**, not just a column
- You need **row-level logic** or **virtual tables**
- You're working with **complex filters** or **dynamic expressions**

Example:

```dax
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price]),
    Sales[Channel] = "Wholesale"
)
```

Here, `SUM` can‚Äôt handle the multiplication‚Äîit only works on a single column. `SUMX` evaluates the expression row-by-row, then aggregates.

**don‚Äôt need `SUMX` inside `CALCULATE`** unless your logic demands it.
