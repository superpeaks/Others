# Python Fundamentals for Data Analytics - Answers with Examples

### 1. How does Python’s dynamic typing benefit rapid data exploration?  
Python allows variable types to be decided at runtime, so you can quickly write and test analytics code without worrying about type declarations. This flexibility speeds up iterative exploration, especially when data types are heterogeneous or unknown initially.  
**Example:** You can assign a number, then reassign a string without errors.  
```python
x = 10      # integer
x = "data"  # string, no issues
```

### 2. Explain the difference between lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries in the context of analytics workflows.  
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections, used for storing data sequences where order matters.  
- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable sequences, often used for fixed records (e.g., coordinates).  
- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements, useful for membership testing and removing duplicates.  
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs for fast lookups, suitable for mapping labels or indexes to values.  
**Example:**  
```python
data_list = [1, 2, 3]            # e.g., time-series values  
coords = (40.7, -74.0)           # fixed location tuple  
unique_ids = {101, 102, 103}     # quick lookup for processed IDs  
mapping = {'Jan': 100, 'Feb': 150}  # map months to sales figures  
```

### 3. When would you use list comprehensions versus generator expressions for data processing?  
Use **list comprehensions** when you want to generate a complete list in memory immediately, suitable for small to medium datasets. Use **generator expressions** to create iterators for lazy evaluation when working with large datasets, reducing memory usage.  
**Example:**  
```python
# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # stores all squares immediately  

# Generator expression
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(10))  # lazily produces squares one by one  
```

### 4. How do you handle file I/O for CSV, JSON, and text files in Python efficiently?  
Using Python’s built-in `open()` with context managers (`with` statement) ensures files are properly opened and closed. For large CSV/JSON files, libraries like **Pandas** or **json** module handle parsing efficiently.  
**Example:**  
```python
# Reading CSV with pandas
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Reading JSON
import json
with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Reading text file line by line
with open('data.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        process(line)
```

### 5. Describe exception handling best practices during batch data ingestion.  
Use try-except blocks to catch anticipated errors (e.g., file not found, malformed rows). Log errors and continue processing to avoid interruption of entire batch jobs. Cleanup resources in finally blocks or use context managers.  
**Example:**  
```python
try:
    with open('data.csv') as f:
        for line in f:
            process(line)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File missing - check input path")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error processing line: {e}")
```

### 6. How can decorators be used to add logging or timing around data-processing functions?  
Decorators wrap functions to add functionality like logging input/output or measuring runtime without changing the function code. Useful for monitoring analytics steps.  
**Example:**  
```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {time.time() - start:.4f}s")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def process_data(data):
    # simulate processing
    time.sleep(1)
    return data

process_data([1,2,3])
```

### 7. What are *args and **kwargs, and how do they help build flexible analytics functions?  
`*args` allows passing a variable number of positional arguments; `**kwargs` allows variable keyword arguments. These make functions adaptable to various input parameters, useful in analytics for experimenting with different parameters.  
**Example:**  
```python
def summarize(*args, **kwargs):
    print(f"Positional args: {args}")
    print(f"Keyword args: {kwargs}")

summarize(1, 2, filter='mean', axis=0)
```

### 8. Explain the use of context managers (`with` statements`) for resource management in ETL jobs.  
Context managers ensure resources like files, database connections are properly acquired and released, even if errors occur. This prevents leaks and locking issues in ETL processes.  
**Example:**  
```python
with open('data.csv') as f:
    contents = f.read()  # file automatically closed after block
```

### 9. How do you profile and optimize slow Python code when processing large datasets?  
Use Python’s `cProfile` or `timeit` modules to identify bottlenecks. Optimize by using vectorized operations (NumPy, Pandas), reducing loops, leveraging built-in functions, or using JIT compilers like Numba.  
**Example:**  
```python
import cProfile

def slow_function():
    sum([i**2 for i in range(1000000)])

cProfile.run('slow_function()')
```

### 10. Compare threading versus multiprocessing for parallel data transformations.  
- **Threading:** Useful for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading multiple files simultaneously) but limited by GIL for CPU-bound tasks.  
- **Multiprocessing:** Spawns separate processes, bypassing GIL; better for CPU-intensive analytics but higher overhead.  
**Example:**  
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor

# Threading example
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.map(fetch_url, urls)

# Multiprocessing example
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.map(process_chunk, data_chunks)
```

# NumPy & Array Operations - Answers with Examples

### 1. Why is NumPy important for data analytics compared to native Python lists?  
NumPy provides efficient storage and operations on homogeneous numerical data through its ndarray object. It allows fast vectorized computations, reducing the need for slow Python loops. NumPy also provides many mathematical functions and linear algebra tools essential for analytics.  
**Example:**  
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr * 2)  # outputs: [2 4 6] (vectorized multiplication)
```

### 2. How do you create arrays, matrices, and multidimensional tensors in NumPy?  
You can create arrays using `np.array()`, specifying nested lists for multiple dimensions. Use `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, or `np.eye()` to create arrays initialized with default values.  
**Example:**  
```python
import numpy as np
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])         # 1D array  
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2D array (matrix)  
arr_3d = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))          # 3D tensor filled with zeros  
```

### 3. Explain broadcasting rules and their benefits for vectorized computations.  
Broadcasting enables arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes by stretching smaller arrays without copying data. It allows writing concise, efficient code instead of manually looping and repeating arrays.  
**Example:**  
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # shape (3,)
b = np.array([[10], [20]])  # shape (2,1)
result = a + b  # b broadcasts to shape (2,3)
```

### 4. How do you perform element-wise operations and reductions (sum, mean, max) on arrays?  
You can use arithmetic operators for element-wise operations. Use built-in functions like `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, and `np.max()` to calculate reductions along specified axes.  
**Example:**  
```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(arr * 2)          # element-wise multiply
print(np.sum(arr))      # total sum: 10
print(np.mean(arr, 0))  # mean along columns: [2. 3.]
```

### 5. Describe slicing and fancy indexing to select subsets of large arrays.  
Slicing allows selecting ranges of elements (`arr[start:stop]`). Fancy indexing lets you select elements using integer or Boolean arrays. This is useful for filtering or locating specific rows/columns.  
**Example:**  
```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
print(arr[1:4])  # output: [20 30 40]
print(arr[[0, 2, 4]])  # output: [10 30 50]
mask = arr > 25
print(arr[mask])  # output: [30 40 50]
```

### 6. How can you compute statistical summaries (mean, median, percentile) efficiently in NumPy?  
Use NumPy functions `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, and `np.percentile()` which are implemented in optimized C code for fast calculations even on large datasets.  
**Example:**  
```python
data = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
print(np.mean(data))       # 5.0
print(np.median(data))     # 5.0
print(np.percentile(data, 80))  # 7.2 (80th percentile)
```

### 7. Explain how to handle NaN or infinite values in NumPy arrays.  
Use functions like `np.isnan()` or `np.isfinite()` to detect NaNs or infinite values. Replace or filter them using functions such as `np.nan_to_num()` or masking.  
**Example:**  
```python
arr = np.array([1, np.nan, 3, np.inf])
print(np.isnan(arr))          # [False  True False False]
cleaned = np.nan_to_num(arr, nan=0, posinf=999)
print(cleaned)                # [1. 0. 3. 999.]
```

### 8. How do you reshape, transpose, and concatenate arrays?  
Use `.reshape()` to change dimensionality, `.T` or `np.transpose()` for swapping axes, and `np.concatenate()` or `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()` to join arrays along specified axes.  
**Example:**  
```python
arr = np.arange(6)
reshaped = arr.reshape(2, 3)      # shape (2,3)
transposed = reshaped.T            # shape (3,2)
concatenated = np.concatenate([reshaped, reshaped], axis=0)  # shape (4,3)
```

### 9. Describe memory layout (C vs. Fortran order) and its impact on performance.  
C-contiguous layout stores rows contiguously, while Fortran-contiguous stores columns contiguously. Accessing elements in memory order improves cache utilization and performance, especially in loops or vectorized ops.  
**Example:**  
```python
arr_c = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], order='C')  # row-major  
arr_f = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], order='F')  # column-major  
```

### 10. How do you use random number generation for simulation and sampling?  
Use `numpy.random` module to generate random values from distributions (uniform, normal, binomial). Useful for Monte Carlo simulations and bootstrapping.  
**Example:**  
```python
rand_uniform = np.random.rand(5)            # uniform [0,1)
rand_normal = np.random.normal(0, 1, 5)     # normal mean=0 std=1
sample_indices = np.random.choice(100, 10, replace=False)  # sample without replacement
```

### 11. Explain vectorized linear algebra operations (dot, matrix multiply, inverse).  
NumPy provides efficient implementations for dot product (`np.dot`), matrix multiplication (`@` operator or `np.matmul`), and inversion (`np.linalg.inv`) essential for regression, PCA, and other analytics operations.  
**Example:**  
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[2, 0], [1, 2]])
print(np.dot(A, B))
print(A @ B)  
print(np.linalg.inv(A))
```

### 12. When would you use structured arrays for heterogeneous tabular data?  
Structured arrays allow heterogeneous data types in a single NumPy array, mimicking database tables with named columns, useful for lightweight tabular data without the overhead of Pandas.  
**Example:**  
```python
dtype = [('name', 'U10'), ('age', 'i4'), ('score', 'f4')]
arr = np.array([('Alice', 25, 85.0), ('Bob', 30, 90.5)], dtype=dtype)
print(arr['name'])
```

### 13. How can you convert between Pandas DataFrames and NumPy arrays seamlessly?  
Pandas DataFrames have a `.values` attribute or `.to_numpy()` method to extract the underlying NumPy array. Conversely, `pd.DataFrame()` can create a DataFrame from a NumPy array.  
**Example:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1,2], 'B': [3,4]})
arr = df.to_numpy()
df2 = pd.DataFrame(arr, columns=['A', 'B'])
```

### 14. Describe performance considerations when working with very large arrays.  
Use memory mapping (`np.memmap`) to handle arrays larger than RAM. Avoid copying arrays unnecessarily; prefer views and slices. Use appropriate data types (`float32` instead of `float64`) to save memory.  
**Example:**  
```python
# Memory mapping large data file without fully loading
arr = np.memmap('large.bin', dtype='float32', mode='r', shape=(10000,10000))
```

### 15. How do you use NumPy’s `ufuncs` to apply custom element-wise functions?  
Use `np.vectorize()` to wrap Python functions for element-wise application, although it’s a convenience, not true vectorization and slower than built-in ufuncs.  
**Example:**  
```python
def my_func(x):
    return x**2 + 1

vectorized_func = np.vectorize(my_func)
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(vectorized_func(arr))  # [2 5 10]
```

# Pandas for Data Wrangling & Analysis - Answers with Examples

### 1. What are the core Pandas data structures, and when do you use Series vs. DataFrame?  
Pandas provides two primary data structures: **Series** and **DataFrame**. A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array suitable for storing a single column or indexable list. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types, ideal for tabular data. Use Series when working with single columns or vectors; use DataFrames to hold and manipulate tables with multiple columns.  
**Example:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
```

### 2. How do you load data from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and Parquet into Pandas?  
Pandas has functions like `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, `read_sql()`, `read_json()`, and `read_parquet()` for loading data from various sources. These functions parse raw files or query results into DataFrames.  
**Example:**  
```python
df_csv = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df_excel = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
df_sql = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM table', conn)
df_json = pd.read_json('data.json')
df_parquet = pd.read_parquet('data.parquet')
```

### 3. Explain the differences and use cases for `loc`, `iloc`, and Boolean indexing.  
- `loc` selects data by label/index, including rows and columns.  
- `iloc` selects data by integer position.  
- Boolean indexing filters data by conditions returning True/False.  
Use `loc` when working with meaningful index labels, and `iloc` for positional slicing. Boolean indexing allows complex condition-based row filtering.  
**Example:**  
```python
df.loc[0, 'A']      # first row, column 'A' by label  
df.iloc[0, 1]       # first row, second column by position  
df[df['A'] > 10]    # rows where column 'A' > 10  
```

### 4. How do you identify and handle missing or null values in a DataFrame?  
Use `isna()` or `isnull()` to detect missing values and `dropna()` to remove or `fillna()` to replace them with a value or method (mean, forward fill). Proper missing value handling is essential to ensure data integrity.  
**Example:**  
```python
df.isna().sum()           # count missing values per column  
df_clean = df.dropna()    # drop rows with any missing values  
df_filled = df.fillna(0)  # replace missing values with zero  
```

### 5. Describe methods to add, rename, and drop columns for feature engineering.  
Add columns by assignment with Series or scalar values. Rename columns with `rename()` or by assigning lists to `df.columns`. Drop columns using `drop()` with `axis=1`.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['new_col'] = df['A'] * 2             # add new feature  
df.rename(columns={'A': 'col_A'}, inplace=True)  # rename column  
df.drop('B', axis=1, inplace=True)                # drop column  
```

### 6. How do you filter rows based on multiple conditions efficiently?  
Use bitwise operators (`&`, `|`) with parentheses for combining conditions in Boolean indexing. Avoid Python’s `and`, `or` as they do not work element-wise.  
**Example:**  
```python
filtered = df[(df['A'] > 10) & (df['B'] < 20)]
```

### 7. Explain grouping, aggregation, and transformation with `groupby`.  
`groupby` splits data by keys, applies aggregation or transformation functions, and combines results. Aggregations summarize groups (`sum`, `mean`), while transformations apply element-wise operations preserving index shape.  
**Example:**  
```python
grouped = df.groupby('category')['sales'].sum()   # sum sales per category  
df['sales_diff'] = df.groupby('category')['sales'].transform(lambda x: x - x.mean())  # center sales  
```

### 8. How do you merge, join, and concatenate DataFrames to combine datasets?  
- `merge()` combines DataFrames on key columns (like SQL joins).  
- `join()` adds columns based on index alignment.  
- `concat()` stacks DataFrames vertically or horizontally.  
**Example:**  
```python
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'key': ['A', 'B'], 'val1': [1, 2]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'key': ['B', 'C'], 'val2': [3, 4]})
merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='inner')  # join on key  
joined = df1.set_index('key').join(df2.set_index('key'))  
concatenated = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)          # vertical stack  
```

### 9. What are pivot tables and melting, and how do they help reshape data?  
- Pivot tables aggregate DataFrame data by index and columns, creating cross-tabs.  
- Melting converts wide data into long format by unpivoting columns into rows.  
These operations are fundamental for reshaping and preparing data for analysis or visualization.  
**Example:**  
```python
pivot = df.pivot_table(values='sales', index='region', columns='month', aggfunc='sum')
melted = pd.melt(df, id_vars=['region'], value_vars=['Jan', 'Feb'], var_name='month', value_name='sales')
```

### 10. Describe time-series indexing, resampling, and rolling-window calculations.  
Set a datetime column as index to leverage time-series functionality. Use `resample()` to change frequency (e.g., daily to monthly aggregates). Rolling methods compute moving statistics like rolling averages, useful for smoothing trends.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
monthly = df.resample('M').sum()
rolling_avg = df['sales'].rolling(window=3).mean()
```

### 11. How do you work with categorical data to reduce memory usage and speed up group operations?  
Convert string columns to categorical type using `astype('category')` to save memory and accelerate grouping and filtering by assigning internal integer codes.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['category'] = df['category'].astype('category')
df.groupby('category').size()
```

### 12. What is a MultiIndex, and how do you select and manipulate hierarchical axes?  
MultiIndex allows multiple levels of indexing on rows or columns, useful for representing grouped or multi-dimensional data compactly. Select with tuples in `.loc`. Methods exist to swap levels or flatten indices.  
**Example:**  
```python
arrays = [['A', 'A', 'B'], [1, 2, 1]]
df = pd.DataFrame({'data': [10, 20, 30]}, index=pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(arrays, names=['letter', 'number']))
df.loc[('A', 2)]
```

### 13. Explain vectorized string operations with the `.str` accessor.  
Pandas `.str` accessor provides vectorized methods to manipulate string data (lowercase, contains, extract via regex), eliminating the need for slow Python loops.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['name'].str.lower()
df['email'].str.contains('@', na=False)
```

### 14. How do you apply custom functions row-wise or element-wise with `apply` and `applymap`?  
- `apply()` applies functions to rows or columns.  
- `applymap()` applies functions element-wise on entire DataFrame.  
They enable complex transformations beyond built-in vectorized methods.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['new_col'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['A'] + row['B'], axis=1)
df = df.applymap(lambda x: x*2 if isinstance(x, (int, float)) else x)
```

### 15. Describe efficient reading of very large files with chunks and `pd.read_csv(chunksize=…)`.  
Use the `chunksize` parameter in `read_csv()` to read data in manageable portions, allowing processing in batches without loading entire data into memory.  
**Example:**  
```python
chunk_iter = pd.read_csv('large.csv', chunksize=5000)
for chunk in chunk_iter:
    process(chunk)
```

### 16. How do you use `query` and `eval` to write expressive, fast data filters?  
`query()` applies filtering expressions as strings, improving readability; `eval()` evaluates expressions on DataFrame columns faster by optimizing execution.  
**Example:**  
```python
df.query('age > 30 and income < 50000')
df.eval('total = income - expenses', inplace=True)
```

### 17. Explain how to detect and remove outliers from a DataFrame.  
Use statistical measures such as IQR or z-score to identify outliers, then filter or replace them to improve data quality.  
**Example:**  
```python
Q1 = df['value'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['value'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
filtered = df[(df['value'] >= (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) & (df['value'] <= (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
```

### 18. How do you perform one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding?  
One-hot creates binary columns for categorical levels; label encoding assigns integer codes. Ordinal encoding respects order in categories. Use scikit-learn’s preprocessing or Pandas’ `get_dummies()`.  
**Example:**  
```python
pd.get_dummies(df['category'])
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df['cat_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(df['category'])
```

### 19. Describe merging DataFrames with non-aligned schemas and handling missing columns.  
Use `merge()` with the `how` argument (`outer`, `left`, `right`) to keep/exclude unmatched rows. Pandas fills missing columns with NaN by default.  
**Example:**  
```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='outer')
```

### 20. How do you profile memory usage and optimize performance of Pandas operations?  
Use `memory_usage()` to check usage per column. Convert types to categories, use smaller numeric types, and avoid inplace operations that create copies to optimize memory and speed.  
**Example:**  
```python
df.memory_usage(deep=True)
df['category_col'] = df['category_col'].astype('category')
```

### 21. Explain exporting DataFrames to CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet, and SQL tables.  
Use `to_csv()`, `to_json()`, `to_excel()`, `to_parquet()`, and `to_sql()` to save cleaned or analyzed data for reporting or further processes.  
**Example:**  
```python
df.to_csv('cleaned.csv', index=False)
df.to_json('cleaned.json')
df.to_excel('report.xlsx')
df.to_parquet('data.parquet')
df.to_sql('table_name', con=engine)
```

### 22. How do you visualize distributions, trends, and correlations with Pandas built-in plots?  
Use `.plot()` method to quickly generate histograms, line plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps for exploratory data analysis.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['sales'].hist()
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='age', y='income')
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(df)
```

### 23. Describe using extension types (e.g., `pd.Categorical`, nullable dtypes).  
Extension types allow handling data with missing values more efficiently and with specific semantics (e.g., nullable integers, categorical variables for low-memory use).  
**Example:**  
```python
df['cat'] = df['cat'].astype('category')
df['nullable_int'] = df['int_col'].astype('Int64')
```

### 24. How do you write custom accessors (`.dt`, `.str`, `.cat`) for domain-specific operations?  
Pandas allows extending DataFrame/Series with `.pipe()` or by defining accessor classes to add chainable custom methods for repeated domain logic.  
**Example:**  
```python
@pd.api.extensions.register_dataframe_accessor("geo")
class GeoAccessor:
    def __init__(self, pandas_obj):
        self._obj = pandas_obj

    def center_of_mass(self):
        return (self._obj['x'] * self._obj['weight']).sum() / self._obj['weight'].sum()
```

### 25. Explain using Pandas with Dask for out-of-core and distributed analytics.  
Dask extends Pandas for parallel and out-of-memory computations by breaking large datasets into smaller chunks processed in parallel, useful for big data analytics.  
**Example:**  
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
ddf = dd.read_csv('large_file.csv')
result = ddf.groupby('col').sum().compute()
```

### 26. How do you handle timezone conversion and localization in time-series data?  
Use `.dt.tz_localize()` to set timezone, and `.dt.tz_convert()` to change timezones, ensuring datetime-aware indexing or analysis.  
**Example:**  
```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['date'] = df['date'].dt.tz_localize('UTC').dt.tz_convert('US/Eastern')
```

### 27. Describe methods for merging and enriching data from multiple sources (S3, SQL, APIs).  
Load data separately using appropriate Pandas readers or libraries like `boto3` for S3 or SQLAlchemy for databases, then combine using `merge()` or `concat()` to enrich datasets for analytics.  
**Example:**  
```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
obj = s3.get_object(Bucket='bucket', Key='file.csv')
df_s3 = pd.read_csv(obj['Body'])
df_final = pd.merge(df_s3, df_sql, on='key')
```

### 28. How do you implement a data-cleaning pipeline with chained methods and function composition?  
Chain Pandas methods to apply sequential cleaning steps clearly. Alternatively, write functions that take and return DataFrames for modular pipelines.  
**Example:**  
```python
(df.drop_duplicates()
   .fillna(0)
   .assign(new_col=lambda x: x['A'] * 2)
   .query('new_col > 10'))
```

### 29. Explain how to detect duplicate records and deduplicate based on complex criteria.  
Use `duplicated()` with subset of columns indicating duplicates, and `drop_duplicates()` to remove them. For complex rules, apply custom filters with `groupby()` or conditional logic.  
**Example:**  
```python
duplicates = df[df.duplicated(subset=['id', 'date'], keep=False)]
df_cleaned = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['id', 'date'], keep='last')
```

### 30. How do you integrate Pandas operations within an Airflow or Prefect ETL workflow?  
Write Pandas transformations as Python callable tasks or operators within the workflow, allowing scheduling, logging, retries, and orchestration of data pipelines.  
**Example:**  
```python
# Airflow PythonOperator example
def transform_data():
    df = pd.read_csv('input.csv')
    df['new_col'] = df['A'] * 2
    df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)

from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
task = PythonOperator(task_id='pandas_task', python_callable=transform_data, dag=dag)
```

# Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn – Answers with Examples

### 1. Why is visualization important in data analytics, and when do you choose Matplotlib vs. Seaborn?  
Visualization helps to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in data, making insights accessible and understandable. Matplotlib is a foundational, highly customizable plotting library suitable for detailed control. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides higher-level, statistical plot types with simpler syntax, making it ideal for quick exploratory data analysis (EDA). Use Seaborn for statistical visualization and Matplotlib when deep customization or complex plots are needed.  
**Example:**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()  # apply Seaborn styles

# Simple line plot with Matplotlib
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.title("Matplotlib Line Plot")
plt.show()

# Seaborn histogram with KDE overlay
sns.histplot(data=[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4])
plt.title("Seaborn Histogram with KDE")
plt.show()
```

### 2. How do you create line, bar, scatter, and histogram plots using Matplotlib?  
Matplotlib provides functions such as `plot()` for line plots, `bar()` for bar charts, `scatter()` for scatter plots, and `hist()` for histograms. Each function allows you to specify data points, labels, colors, markers, etc.  
**Example:**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Line plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], label='Line')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Bar plot
plt.bar(['A', 'B', 'C'], [5, 7, 3])
plt.show()

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
plt.show()

# Histogram
plt.hist([1,2,2,3,3,4,5], bins=4)
plt.show()
```

### 3. Explain customizing plot aesthetics (colors, markers, line styles, axes labels).  
You can customize plots by specifying color via the `color` parameter, markers with `marker`, line styles with `linestyle` or shorthand symbols, and set axis labels and titles with `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, and `title()`. Legends are added with `legend()`.  
**Example:**  
```python
plt.plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6], color='green', marker='o', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')
plt.title('Customized Plot')
plt.legend(['Data'])
plt.show()
```

### 4. How do you overlay multiple plots and add legends, titles, and annotations?  
Plot multiple datasets sequentially; each command modifies the current figure. Use `legend()` to describe lines, `title()` for heading, and `annotate()` to add text with arrows at specific points.  
**Example:**  
```python
plt.plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6], label='Line 1')
plt.plot([1,2,3], [6,5,4], label='Line 2')
plt.title('Multiple Lines')
plt.legend()
plt.annotate('Peak', xy=(3,6), xytext=(2,7),
             arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))
plt.show()
```

### 5. Describe subplots and grid layouts for presenting multiple charts.  
Use `plt.subplot()` or `plt.subplots()` to create grids of plots, allowing side-by-side or stacked visualizations. Share axes for easier comparison and control spacing with parameters.  
**Example:**  
```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10,4))
axs[0].plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
axs[0].set_title('Plot 1')
axs[1].bar([1,2,3], [3,2,5])
axs[1].set_title('Plot 2')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 6. How do you use Seaborn’s `relplot`, `catplot`, `heatmap`, and `pairplot` functions?  
- `relplot()` is for relational plots like scatter or line plots with easy faceting.  
- `catplot()` creates categorical plots (box, violin, bar) with grouping.  
- `heatmap()` visualizes matrices or correlation tables with color intensity.  
- `pairplot()` shows pairwise relationships across multiple variables with scatterplots and histograms.  
**Example:**  
```python
import seaborn as sns
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')

sns.relplot(x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', data=df)
sns.catplot(x='species', y='sepal_length', kind='box', data=df)
corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
sns.pairplot(df, hue='species')
plt.show()
```

### 7. Explain distribution plots (`distplot`, `kdeplot`, `histplot`) and their parameters.  
These plots visualize the data distribution shape. `histplot()` shows histograms; `kdeplot()` shows smoothed density estimates; `distplot()` (deprecated, use histplot/kdeplot) combined both. Parameters include `bins`, `kde`, `rug`, and `stat`.  
**Example:**  
```python
sns.histplot(df['sepal_length'], bins=10, kde=True)
plt.show()
```

### 8. How do you visualize categorical comparisons with boxplots, violin plots, and swarm plots?  
- Boxplots summarize distribution with quartiles and outliers.  
- Violin plots add a kernel density estimation for data shape.  
- Swarm plots show all individual points avoiding overlap, useful for small datasets.  
**Example:**  
```python
sns.boxplot(x='species', y='sepal_length', data=df)
sns.violinplot(x='species', y='sepal_length', data=df)
sns.swarmplot(x='species', y='sepal_length', data=df)
plt.show()
```

### 9. Describe creating correlation matrices and annotated heatmaps for EDA.  
Calculate a correlation matrix with `.corr()` method and visualize with Seaborn’s `heatmap()`, optionally annotating values to identify relationships.  
**Example:**  
```python
corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```

### 10. How do you customize themes and styles with Seaborn’s context, style, and palette settings?  
Seaborn allows changing overall aesthetics using `set_style()`, `set_context()`, and color palettes with `color_palette()`. These control fonts, gridlines, colors, making plots publication-ready.  
**Example:**  
```python
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
sns.set_context('talk')
sns.set_palette('pastel')
sns.histplot(df['sepal_length'])
plt.show()
```

### 11. Explain interactive plotting options with Matplotlib widgets or Plotly integration.  
Matplotlib widgets like sliders or buttons enable simple interactivity. For richer, web-ready interactive plots, Plotly provides built-in zooming, hovering, and selection features.  
**Example:**  
```python
# Plotly example for interactive scatter plot
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(df, x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', color='species')
fig.show()
```

### 12. How can you export high-quality figures for reports and presentations?  
Use `savefig()` to export plots to PNG, PDF, SVG, or EPS with adjustable DPI and size to ensure clarity in reports or slides.  
**Example:**  
```python
plt.plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
plt.savefig('plot.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

### 13. Describe adding text, arrows, and custom shapes to emphasize insights.  
Use Matplotlib’s `text()`, `annotate()`, and `patches` (e.g., Rectangle, Circle) functions to highlight regions or add descriptive labels. Helpful to guide the viewer’s attention.  
**Example:**  
```python
plt.plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
plt.annotate('Peak', xy=(3,6), xytext=(2,5),
             arrowprops=dict(facecolor='red', shrink=0.05))
plt.text(1,4, 'Start Point')
plt.show()
```

### 14. How do you animate plots for time-series data using Matplotlib’s `FuncAnimation`?  
`FuncAnimation` updates plot elements frame-by-frame to create animations, ideal for displaying evolving trends over time.  
**Example:**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x_data, y_data = [], []
line, = ax.plot([], [], 'r-')

def update(frame):
    x_data.append(frame)
    y_data.append(frame**0.5)
    line.set_data(x_data, y_data)
    ax.relim()
    ax.autoscale_view()
    return line,

ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=range(50), blit=True)
plt.show()
```

### 15. Explain best practices for choosing chart types and avoiding misleading visualizations.  
Choose chart types that clearly represent data relationships (e.g., trend lines for time, bars for categorical comparison). Avoid 3D charts with distortion, truncating axes improperly, or confusing scales. Always label axes and include legends. Strive for simplicity and clarity.

Certainly! Here are medium-length answers with examples for the next section:

# Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing - Answers with Examples

### 1. What are descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, skewness, kurtosis) and how do you compute them in Python?  
Descriptive statistics summarize data characteristics:  
- **Mean:** average value  
- **Median:** middle value when sorted  
- **Mode:** most frequent value  
- **Variance:** measure of spread or variability  
- **Skewness:** asymmetry of distribution  
- **Kurtosis:** peakedness or tail heaviness  
Use libraries like NumPy, SciPy, or Pandas for calculations.  
**Example:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis, mode

data = pd.Series([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print('Mean:', data.mean())
print('Median:', data.median())
print('Mode:', data.mode()[0])
print('Variance:', data.var())
print('Skewness:', skew(data))
print('Kurtosis:', kurtosis(data))
```

### 2. Explain probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson) and their use cases.  
- **Normal distribution:** Continuous, bell-shaped, models natural variations (e.g., test scores).  
- **Binomial distribution:** Discrete, models number of successes in fixed trials (e.g., coin toss).  
- **Poisson distribution:** Discrete, models number of events in fixed interval (e.g., calls per hour).  
Use SciPy to work with these distributions for probabilities and sampling.  
**Example:**  
```python
from scipy.stats import norm, binom, poisson

# Normal PDF at 0
print(norm.pdf(0, loc=0, scale=1))

# Binomial PMF for 3 successes in 10 trials
print(binom.pmf(3, n=10, p=0.5))

# Poisson PMF for 2 events
print(poisson.pmf(2, mu=1.5))
```

### 3. How do you perform and interpret correlation versus causation analysis?  
Correlation measures statistical association between variables but does not imply causation. Use correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman) to quantify linear or rank relationships. Causation requires experimental or domain expertise evidence beyond correlation.  
**Example:**  
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [2, 4, 6]})
print(df.corr(method='pearson'))  # strong positive correlation
```

### 4. Describe t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA in Python (SciPy).  
- **t-test:** compares means of two groups (independent or paired).  
- **Chi-square test:** tests independence between categorical variables.  
- **ANOVA:** compares means across multiple groups.  
Use `scipy.stats` functions like `ttest_ind`, `chi2_contingency`, and `f_oneway`.  
**Example:**  
```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind, chi2_contingency, f_oneway
import numpy as np

group1 = np.random.randn(20)
group2 = np.random.randn(20) + 1
print(ttest_ind(group1, group2))

table = [[10, 20], [20, 30]]
print(chi2_contingency(table))

group3 = np.random.randn(20) + 2
print(f_oneway(group1, group2, group3))
```

### 5. How do you calculate confidence intervals and margin of error?  
Confidence intervals estimate a range containing the true parameter with a given probability (e.g., 95%). Margin of error is half the width of this interval. Calculate using sample mean, standard error, and critical values from t-distribution.  
**Example:**  
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import t

data = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
n = len(data)
mean = np.mean(data)
std_err = np.std(data, ddof=1) / np.sqrt(n)
ci_range = t.ppf(0.975, n-1) * std_err
print(f"95% CI: [{mean - ci_range}, {mean + ci_range}]")
```

### 6. Explain p-values, statistical significance, and Type I/II errors.  
- **p-value:** Probability of observing data as extreme as sample under null hypothesis.  
- **Statistical significance:** Reject null if p-value < threshold (e.g., 0.05).  
- **Type I error:** False positive - incorrectly rejecting true null.  
- **Type II error:** False negative - failing to reject false null.  
Balance between these errors guides test design and conclusions.

### 7. How do you perform non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon)?  
Non-parametric tests assess differences without normality assumption. Mann-Whitney U compares two independent groups; Wilcoxon tests paired samples for median differences. Use SciPy functions `mannwhitneyu` and `wilcoxon`.  
**Example:**  
```python
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu, wilcoxon

group1 = [1,2,3]
group2 = [2,3,4]
print(mannwhitneyu(group1, group2))

paired1 = [1,2,3]
paired2 = [2,2,3]
print(wilcoxon(paired1, paired2))
```

### 8. Describe bootstrapping and permutation tests for small-sample inference.  
These are resampling methods to estimate distributions of statistics when assumptions are unclear. Bootstrapping samples with replacement; permutation tests shuffle labels to test hypotheses. Useful for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.  
**Example:**  
```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
bootstrap_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(data, size=len(data), replace=True)) for _ in range(1000)]
```

### 9. How do you fit and evaluate linear regression models with statsmodels or scikit-learn?  
Use `statsmodels.api.OLS` or `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` to fit models. Statsmodels offers detailed statistical inference tables; scikit-learn offers simple fit/predict API. Evaluate with R², RMSE, residual analysis.  
**Example:**  
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np

X = sm.add_constant(np.array([1,2,3,4]))
y = np.array([2,3,5,7])
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

### 10. Explain logistic regression and interpreting odds ratios.  
Logistic regression models binary outcomes' probability using a logistic function. Coefficients exponentiated (odds ratios) indicate the change in odds per unit increase in a predictor.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X = [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
print(model.coef_)
print(np.exp(model.coef_))  # odds ratios
```

### 11. How do you assess model assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity)?  
Use residual plots for homoscedasticity, Q-Q plots or tests for normality, and calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.  
**Example:**  
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

residuals = model.resid
sm.qqplot(residuals, line='s')
# Calculate VIF for each feature
X = ... # feature matrix
vif = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
```

### 12. Describe model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R², precision, recall, ROC AUC).  
- **RMSE:** Root mean squared error measures average magnitude of errors.  
- **MAE:** Mean absolute error averages absolute differences.  
- **R²:** Proportion of variance explained.  
- **Precision/Recall:** Classification metrics assessing false positives/negatives.  
- **ROC AUC:** Area under curve measuring binary classification performance.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, precision_score, recall_score, roc_auc_score

y_true = [0,1,1,0]
y_pred = [0,1,0,0]
print(precision_score(y_true, y_pred))
```

### 13. How do you handle imbalanced classes in classification tasks?  
Use techniques like oversampling minority class (SMOTE), undersampling majority, class weighting, or anomaly detection models to improve classification.  
**Example:**  
```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

sm = SMOTE()
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X, y)
```

### 14. Explain time-series decomposition, stationarity tests (ADF), and ARIMA modeling.  
Decomposition separates time-series into trend, seasonality, and residuals. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test checks stationarity. ARIMA models autoregression, integration (differencing), and moving average to forecast time-series.  
**Example:**  
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

result = seasonal_decompose(ts_data)
print(adfuller(ts_data))
model = ARIMA(ts_data, order=(1,1,1)).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

### 15. How do you use Python to automate hypothesis testing in A/B experiments?  
Define null and alternative hypotheses, choose appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test for means), calculate p-values programmatically, and make data-driven decisions.  
**Example:**  
```python
import scipy.stats as stats

control = [1,0,1,1,0]
variant = [1,1,0,1,1]
stat, p = stats.ttest_ind(control, variant)
if p < 0.05:
    print("Reject null hypothesis")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis")
```

# SQL & Database Interaction - Answers with Examples

### 1. Why is SQL knowledge essential for data analysts working with Python?  
SQL is critical because many enterprises store data in relational databases. Data analysts use SQL to extract, filter, aggregate, and join data efficiently before or during analysis. Python interfaces with databases using SQL to automate data retrieval and preprocessing, enabling seamless analytics pipelines.  

### 2. How do you connect to a SQL database from Python using SQLAlchemy or `pyodbc`?  
SQLAlchemy provides a high-level ORM and connection management; `pyodbc` is a low-level driver for ODBC databases. Use connection strings/URLs to connect.  
**Example (SQLAlchemy):**  
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')
connection = engine.connect()
result = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
for row in result:
    print(row)
connection.close()
```

### 3. Describe writing parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  
Parameterized queries use placeholders with parameter binding rather than string concatenation, preventing malicious injection attacks. Both `execute()` methods in libraries support this.  
**Example:**  
```python
user_id = 123
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
result = connection.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### 4. How do you load SQL query results directly into Pandas DataFrames?  
Use Pandas’ `read_sql_query()` or `read_sql_table()` functions with an active SQL connection to import query results as DataFrames.  
**Example:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30", con=engine)
```

### 5. Explain joining tables (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and their analytics use cases.  
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns matching rows from both tables.  
- **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all from left table, matching rows or nulls from right.  
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all from right table, matching or nulls from left.  
- **FULL JOIN:** Returns rows with matches in either table.  
Joins allow combining separate datasets to enrich analysis.  
**Example:**  
```sql
SELECT a.*, b.sales 
FROM customers a 
LEFT JOIN sales b ON a.id = b.customer_id;
```

### 6. How do you perform aggregations, window functions, and CTEs in SQL?  
Use `GROUP BY` with aggregation functions (SUM, AVG). Window functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`) compute over partitions without collapsing rows. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) simplify complex queries via named temporary result sets.  
**Example:**  
```sql
WITH ranked_sales AS (
  SELECT customer_id, sales, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY sales DESC) as rank
  FROM sales
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_sales WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 7. Describe indexing strategies to speed up query performance.  
Indexes create data structures to quickly locate rows by indexed columns, especially on keys and frequently filtered columns, drastically speeding up query execution. Use appropriate index types and avoid over-indexing.  

### 8. How can you push down complex filters from Pandas to SQL for efficiency?  
Use SQL queries with WHERE clauses in `read_sql_query()` instead of loading entire tables into memory. This “pushdown” reduces data transfer and leverages database engine optimizations.  
**Example:**  
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM sales WHERE region = 'North' AND amount > 1000"
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, con=engine)
```

### 9. Explain managing database transactions and rollback on error.  
Transactions group multiple SQL statements with commit/rollback atomicity. Python libraries provide transaction controls, allowing rollback on exception to maintain data integrity.  
**Example:**  
```python
try:
    with engine.begin() as connection:
        connection.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'A')")
        connection.execute("UPDATE table SET val='B' WHERE id=1")
except Exception:
    print("Transaction failed, rolled back")
```

### 10. How do you implement incremental data loads (upserts) via Python scripts?  
Use `MERGE` or database-specific syntax to insert new rows and update existing ones. Alternatively, scripts select changed data and apply inserts or updates accordingly.  
**Example:**  
```sql
MERGE INTO target_table AS t
USING source_table AS s
ON t.id = s.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET val = s.val
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, val) VALUES (s.id, s.val);
```

### 11. Describe exporting Analytics results back into SQL tables or data warehouses.  
Use Pandas’ `to_sql()` method to write DataFrames back into SQL tables, specifying `if_exists` to append or replace. This integrates analytics into broader data ecosystems.  
**Example:**  
```python
df.to_sql('results', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

### 12. How do you handle large result sets with server-side cursors or chunked fetch?  
Use server-side cursors or chunked fetch in libraries like `psycopg2` or Pandas `read_sql_query(chunksize=...)` to process data iteratively without loading all rows into memory.  
**Example:**  
```python
for chunk in pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM large_table', con=engine, chunksize=10000):
    process(chunk)
```

### 13. Explain connecting to cloud data warehouses (Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake).  
Use cloud-specific APIs and connectors (e.g., `redshift_connector`, `google-cloud-bigquery`, `snowflake-connector-python`) to authenticate and query managed warehouse data from Python for scalable analytics.  

### 14. How do you use ORMs versus raw SQL for analytics pipelines?  
ORMs like SQLAlchemy facilitate object-oriented querying with abstractions making development easier, but raw SQL provides more control and performance for complex analytics queries. Use ORMs for general operations, raw SQL for optimized analytics.  

### 15. Describe best practices for credentials management and secure connections.  
Store credentials securely using environment variables, config files with restricted permissions, or secret management tools. Use SSL/TLS connections to encrypt data in transit. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in scripts.

# Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn - Answers with Examples

### 1. How does scikit-learn’s Estimator API simplify building ML pipelines?  
Scikit-learn’s Estimator API provides a consistent interface with `fit()`, `predict()`, and `transform()` methods across models and transformers. This standardization facilitates building and chaining reusable pipelines, cross-validation, and parameter tuning seamlessly.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)       # Train model
preds = model.predict(X_test)     # Predict labels
```

### 2. Explain train/test splits, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Train/test split:** Dividing data into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.  
- **Cross-validation:** Repeatedly splitting data for robust performance estimation.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Searching for optimal model parameters (e.g., regularization strength) using methods like grid search.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

params = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10]}
grid = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(), params)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid.best_params_)
```

### 3. How do you preprocess data with `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, and `Pipeline`?  
Use `StandardScaler` to normalize features, and `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical variables to binary vectors. Combine steps into a `Pipeline` to automate repeatable workflows.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

numeric_features = ['age', 'income']
categorical_features = ['gender']

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features),
    ('cat', OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features)
])

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('prep', preprocessor),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression())
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4. Describe fitting and evaluating decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.  
Decision trees partition data by feature thresholds; random forests build ensembles of trees averaging their predictions to reduce variance; gradient boosting adds trees sequentially to correct errors. Evaluate with accuracy, precision, or other metrics depending on use case.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(model.score(X_test, y_test))
```

### 5. How do you interpret feature importance scores and partial dependence plots?  
Feature importance quantifies how much each input influences the model prediction, valuable for explainability. Partial dependence plots visualize the relationship between a feature and predicted outcome marginalizing over other features.  
**Example:**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
importances = model.feature_importances_
plt.bar(range(len(importances)), importances)
plt.show()
```

### 6. Explain K-means clustering and metrics for cluster validity.  
K-means partitions data by minimizing within-cluster variance. Evaluate clustering using silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index to measure cohesion and separation.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
print(silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_))
```

### 7. How do you perform dimensionality reduction with PCA or t-SNE?  
PCA projects data onto principal components to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance. t-SNE maps high-dimensional data to low dimensions preserving local structure, useful for visualization.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)

from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)
```

### 8. Describe grid search versus randomized search for hyperparameter optimization.  
- Grid search exhaustively tries all parameter combinations.  
- Randomized search samples parameter combinations randomly, often faster for large parameter spaces.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

param_dist = {'n_estimators': [50, 100, 150], 'max_depth': [5, 10, None]}
rand_search = RandomizedSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_distributions=param_dist, n_iter=5)
rand_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 9. How can you integrate scikit-learn pipelines within a broader ETL process?  
Wrap preprocessing and modeling steps into pipelines embedded as functions or jobs within ETL tools (e.g., Airflow), allowing automated training, prediction, and model updates in production workflows.  
**Example:**  
```python
def train_model(input_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(input_path)
    X, y = df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target']
    pipeline.fit(X, y)
    joblib.dump(pipeline, 'model.pkl')
```

### 10. Explain handling missing values and categorical features in ML workflows.  
Impute missing data using mean, median, or predictive models. Encode categorical features with one-hot, label encoding, or embeddings to convert to numerical formats compatible with models.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)
```

### 11. How do you serialize and deploy trained models using `joblib` or `pickle`?  
Save models to disk using `joblib.dump()` or `pickle.dump()` for later reuse or deployment into services. Load models back with corresponding load functions for prediction on new data.  
**Example:**  
```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'rf_model.joblib')
loaded_model = joblib.load('rf_model.joblib')
```

### 12. Describe evaluating classification models with confusion matrix and ROC curves.  
Confusion matrix shows true positives, false positives, etc. ROC curve plots true positive rate vs. false positive rate over thresholds. These evaluate classification accuracy and robustness.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, roc_curve, roc_auc_score
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1])
print("AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]))
```

### 13. How do you detect and mitigate overfitting and underfitting?  
Use techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, pruning, early stopping, and choosing appropriate model complexity. Evaluate on separate test sets to detect over/underfitting.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
print("Cross-validated score:", scores.mean())
```

### 14. Explain building custom transformers by extending `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`.  
Create reusable preprocessing steps by defining classes with `fit()` and `transform()` methods, integrating seamlessly into pipelines.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin

class LogTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self
    def transform(self, X):
        return np.log1p(X)
```

### 15. How can you use feature selection techniques (SelectKBest, Recursive Feature Elimination)?  
SelectKBest chooses features based on univariate statistical tests. Recursive Feature Elimination iteratively removes least important features based on model weights to improve model simplicity and performance.  
**Example:**  
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif, RFE
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=5)
X_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
rfe = RFE(LogisticRegression(), n_features_to_select=5)
X_rfe = rfe.fit_transform(X, y)
```

**Example (Flask snippet):**  
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)
model = joblib.load('model.joblib')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    pred = model.predict([data['features']])
    return jsonify({'prediction': pred[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### 12. Explain techniques for blue-green or canary deployments of analytics services.  
Blue-green deploys new versions alongside old ones and switches traffic when validated, minimizing downtime. Canary deploys gradually release new features to a subset of users for safe rollout and monitoring.  

### 13. How do you implement rollback strategies when a deployed data pipeline fails?  
Automate version tracking, backup snapshots, and conditional triggers to revert to previous stable pipeline/state on failure. Integrate notifications for monitoring and manual intervention when needed.  

### 14. Describe testing strategies for end-to-end analytics workflows.  
Combine unit tests for individual components, integration tests for data flow, and system tests for entire pipelines using test datasets to validate data transformations and model predictions.
